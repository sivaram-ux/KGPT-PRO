### **1.1 Introduction: Genesis and Vision**

#### **Founding and Historical Context**

The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur holds the distinction of being the first and the oldest among the IITs, founded on August 18, 1951\.1 Its establishment was a direct outcome of India's post-independence vision for industrial and technological self-reliance. The genesis of the IIT system dates back to 1946, when a committee led by Sir Jogendra Singh, Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, was formed to conceptualize higher technical institutions for post-war development. This led to the formation of a 22-member committee headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, which recommended the creation of four premier technical institutes modeled on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA.1

The first of these institutions was established in May 1950 as the Eastern Higher Technical Institute, initially operating from Calcutta before shifting to its permanent campus at Hijli, Kharagpur, in September 1950\.1 The name "Indian Institute of Technology" was adopted just before its formal inauguration by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on August 18, 1951\.3 The first academic session commenced in August 1951 with 224 students and 42 teachers across ten departments.1

#### **Unique Heritage**

IIT Kharagpur's campus possesses a unique and profound historical significance, being located at the site of the former Hijli Detention Camp. This facility was used during British colonial rule to imprison political revolutionaries, making IIT Kharagpur the only academic institution in the world to have started its journey within a former prison.1 This historical site witnessed a tragic event on September 16, 1931, when British police shot and killed two unarmed detainees, Santosh Kumar Mitra and Tarakeswar Sengupta. The incident drew national condemnation from leaders like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Rabindranath Tagore.3 This legacy is preserved and honored on campus, with the historic main building of the detention camp now renamed Shaheed Bhawan and housing the Nehru Museum of Science & Technology.1 This heritage is not merely a historical footnote but a core component of the institute's identity. The signage at the front of the main academic building, "Dedicated to the service of the nation," directly reflects this legacy of sacrifice and national purpose.1 This narrative of national service is consistently reinforced in official communications, distinguishing IIT Kharagpur from its peers and instilling a sense of historical responsibility within its community.

#### **Institutional Mandate and Motto**

On September 15, 1956, the Parliament of India passed the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act, formally declaring it an "Institute of National Importance" and granting it the status of an autonomous university.1 This mandate was further elevated in 2019 when the Government of India awarded it the status of an "Institute of Eminence," recognizing its exceptional contributions to education and research.1

The institute's guiding philosophy is encapsulated in its motto, *Yogaḥ Karmasu Kauśalam* (योगःकर्मसुकौशलम्), a verse from the Bhagavad Gita which translates to "Excellence in action is Yoga".1 This principle underscores a commitment to achieving perfection and skill in all endeavors. The institutional vision is multi-faceted: to be a global center of excellence in education and research, to serve as a hub for knowledge creation in areas of national and global importance, and ultimately, to improve the life of every citizen of the country.6

### **1.2 Governance and Administrative Structure**

The administrative framework of IIT Kharagpur is hierarchical, designed to oversee its vast academic and operational domains. The institute is helmed by a Director, who serves as the principal academic and executive officer, supported by a Deputy Director and a Registrar.7

The broader governance is managed by statutory bodies. The Board of Governors is the highest decision-making body, responsible for the overall superintendence and control of the institute. Financial matters are overseen by the Finance Committee.7 The Senate is the supreme academic authority, responsible for all academic policies, including curricula, examinations, and the granting of degrees. Its rulings, under the chairmanship of the Director, are final on all academic issues.8

Day-to-day academic and administrative functions are managed by a council of Deans, each responsible for a specific portfolio. Key among these are the Dean of Students' Affairs, who oversees student welfare and discipline; the Dean of Research and Development, who manages the SRIC; the Dean of Outreach; and the Deans of various faculties such as Bio Science and Biotechnology, Engineering & Architecture, and Sciences.10 This structure ensures specialized oversight across the institute's diverse functions.

### **2.1 Curriculum Structure and Flexibility**

IIT Kharagpur's academic framework is built on a credit-based semester system, comprising two primary semesters each academic year: an Autumn Semester (July to November) and a Spring Semester (January to April). Each semester consists of approximately 90 working days.8

A key feature of the undergraduate curriculum is its emphasis on both foundational depth and interdisciplinary breadth. All first-year B.Tech. students undergo a common core curriculum that includes foundational courses in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Electrical Technology, Mechanics, and Programming and Data Structures.21 This shared foundation ensures that all engineering graduates possess a robust and uniform understanding of basic scientific and engineering principles before delving into their specialized disciplines.

Beyond this core, the curriculum is designed with significant flexibility to cater to the diverse interests of students and the evolving demands of the industry. This flexibility is manifested through several academic options:

* **Minors and Micro-Specializations:** Students who maintain a good academic standing (CGPA of 7.0 or higher with no backlogs after the first year) can pursue a Minor in a discipline different from their major. This requires completing a specified set of subjects. Similarly, Micro-Specializations, which consist of 3-4 targeted courses and a project, are also available.8  
* **Interdisciplinary Program Switch:** After the first year, students have the option to switch to interdisciplinary Dual Degree programs in emerging fields like Financial Engineering and Engineering Entrepreneurship.24  
* **Switch to Dual Degree:** B.Tech. (Hons.) students have the option to convert their program to a five-year Dual Degree (B.Tech \+ M.Tech) at the end of their sixth semester, allowing for deeper specialization and a postgraduate qualification.24

This structure is strategically designed to produce well-rounded professionals. The common first year builds a strong technical base, while the options for minors, micro-specializations, and interdisciplinary tracks allow students to cultivate T-shaped skill sets—deep expertise in their major complemented by broad knowledge in other domains. This academic versatility is a significant factor in the high placement rates of IIT Kharagpur graduates across a wide range of sectors, including finance, consulting, and analytics, in addition to core engineering roles.26

## **Part III: Admissions, Policies, and Financial Information**

### **3.0 Admissions Process (2025-26)**

Admission to the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur is a highly competitive process, governed by national-level entrance examinations and centralized counseling systems. The specific process varies by program level.

Undergraduate Admissions:  
Admission to all undergraduate programs, including the 4-year B.Tech. (Hons.), 4-year B.S., 5-year B.Arch. (Hons.), and 5-year Dual Degree courses, is exclusively based on the rank achieved in the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced. To be eligible for JEE Advanced, candidates must first qualify in the JEE Main examination. A minimum of 75% aggregate marks (65% for SC/ST/PwD) in the Class 12 or equivalent examination is also required.13 The final seat allotment is conducted through the centralized  
**Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) Counselling** process.17

**Postgraduate Admissions:**

* **M.Tech. and M.C.P.:** The primary channel for admission is a valid score in the **Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE)**. Seat allocation is managed through the **Common Offer Acceptance Portal (COAP)**. IIT graduates with a CGPA of 8.0 or higher may be eligible for direct admission without a GATE score.17  
* **M.Sc.:** Admission is based on the rank obtained in the **Indian Institute of Technology Joint Admission Test for Masters (JAM)**. Counseling and seat allocation are managed through the **JOAPS portal**.17  
* **MBA and EMBA:** Candidates are shortlisted based on their score in the **Common Admission Test (CAT)**. Shortlisted candidates are then required to appear for a Personal Interview (PI) conducted by the Vinod Gupta School of Management.17  
* **LLB and LLM:** The Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law conducts its own entrance examination, which includes a Computer Based Test (CBT) followed by a Personal Interview (PI) for shortlisted candidates.17

Doctoral Admissions (Ph.D. and M.S. by Research):  
Admission to research programs is typically conducted twice a year. Candidates are shortlisted based on their performance in national-level examinations such as GATE, CSIR-NET JRF, or JEST. Shortlisted candidates are then invited for an institute-level written test and/or a personal interview conducted by the respective department or school.17

### **3.1 Academic Regulations and Policies**

The academic life at IIT Kharagpur is governed by a comprehensive set of regulations and policies established by the Senate to ensure high standards of education and conduct.

#### **Grading System**

IIT Kharagpur employs a 10-point letter grading system to evaluate student performance. Each letter grade corresponds to a numerical grade point, which is used for calculating the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).33

The grade points are assigned as follows:

* **EX (Excellent):** 10 points  
* **A (Very Good):** 9 points  
* **B (Good):** 8 points  
* **C (Fair):** 7 points  
* **D (Average):** 6 points  
* **P (Pass):** 5 points  
* **F (Fail):** 0 points

The institute often uses a **relative grading** system, particularly in courses with large enrollments. In this system, a student's grade is determined by their performance relative to the rest of the class, rather than on an absolute scale of marks. While the exact distribution can vary by professor and course, typically the class average performance is benchmarked to a 'C' or 'B' grade.35

#### **CGPA Calculation**

The academic performance of a student is quantified by the SGPA and CGPA.

* SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average): Calculated at the end of each semester, it is the credit-weighted average of the grade points obtained in all courses registered during that semester.

  SGPA=∑i=1n​ci​∑i=1n​(ci​×gi​)​

  where ci​ is the number of credits for the i-th course, and gi​ is the grade point obtained in that course.8  
* **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average):** Calculated at the end of each semester, it represents the cumulative performance from the first semester onwards. It is the credit-weighted average of grade points obtained in all courses taken up to that semester.8

An 'F' grade contributes zero points to the calculation. If a student successfully clears a failed course in a subsequent attempt, the new grade replaces the 'F' grade, and the SGPA and CGPA of all affected semesters are recomputed.8

#### **Attendance Policy**

Attendance in all academic activities, including lectures, tutorials, and laboratory sessions, is **compulsory**. The institute reserves the right to debar a student from appearing in an examination due to unsatisfactory attendance, which can lead to the cancellation of registration for that subject.38

#### **Student Conduct and Academic Integrity**

IIT Kharagpur enforces a strict code of conduct. Acts such as ragging, consumption of alcohol, and use of narcotics are illegal and strictly prohibited, leading to severe disciplinary action.40 Disciplinary matters are handled by a tiered system: minor infractions within a Hall of Residence are addressed by the Warden, while major acts of indiscipline are referred to the Students Disciplinary Committee. Cases of academic malpractice, such as cheating in examinations, are handled by the Committee on Examination Malpractice.40

**Plagiarism** is considered a serious academic offense. While a singular, consolidated institutional policy document on plagiarism is not available in the provided materials, the institute's stance on ethics is clear.41 The existence of an Institute Ethical Committee (IEC) and the procedures at other premier IITs suggest a stringent approach. For instance, IIT Kanpur's Thesis Processing Cell uses Turnitin software and considers a similarity index of 10% or less to be acceptable.42 Punishments for academic dishonesty at IITs are severe and can range from a failing grade in the course or the entire semester to suspension or even expulsion from the institute, depending on the gravity of the offense.43

### **3.2 Fee Structure and Financial Assistance (2025-26)**

## **Part VI: Global Engagement**

### **6.0 Office of International Relations (OIR)**

The internationalization of education and research is a key strategic priority for IIT Kharagpur. This effort is spearheaded by the **Office of International Relations (OIR)**, which works to integrate an international and intercultural dimension into the institute's core activities. The OIR operates under the Dean of Outreach and is supported by a student body, the **International Relations Cell (IRC)**, which was established in 2015\.74

The primary mandate of the OIR is to expand IIT Kharagpur's global footprint. This is achieved through a variety of initiatives aimed at fostering collaborations, promoting mobility, and enhancing the institute's international reputation. Key activities include:

* **Developing International Partnerships:** The OIR is responsible for establishing and managing relationships with high-quality academic institutions worldwide, often formalized through Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs).74  
* **Facilitating Student and Faculty Exchange:** A core function is to promote the exchange of students, faculty, and ideas. This includes managing the International Semester Exchange Program, where students can study for a semester or two at a partner university.74  
* **Supporting International Internships:** The OIR, through the IRC, operates a "Foreign Training Portal" to assist students in securing international internships, providing them with valuable global work experience.74  
* **Enhancing Global Ranking:** A stated goal of the OIR is to assist the institute in improving its global rank and reputation among international audiences, recognizing that international collaboration and engagement are key metrics in global university rankings.74

### **6.1 International Partnerships and Programs**

IIT Kharagpur's commitment to global engagement is reflected in its active partnerships and structured programs designed to provide students and faculty with international exposure.

* **Student Exchange Programs:** The institute has an established International Semester Exchange Program that allows students to study at a partner institution abroad for one or two semesters. A significant advantage of this program is that students continue to pay their tuition fees to IIT Kharagpur, making the opportunity more financially accessible.74  
* **Collaborative Research:** IIT Kharagpur engages in high-level, collaborative research with leading global universities. A prominent example is the **Indo-German Collaborative Research Center on Intelligent Transportation Systems**, a joint initiative with the prestigious **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**. Such collaborations not only advance research in frontier areas but also provide opportunities for joint supervision of research students and faculty mobility.76  
* **Financial Support for International Activities:** Recognizing that financial constraints can be a barrier to global opportunities, the institute and its alumni have put in place robust support mechanisms. The **Shri Gopal Rajgarhia (SGR) Student International Travel Programme** provides formal financial assistance for students participating in international conferences, competitions, and research projects.46 Furthermore, the  
  **IITKGP Foundation USA** offers competitive awards, typically ranging from $3,000 to $5,000, to meritorious students to help fund their internships at top global universities and corporations.49

The structured approach to internationalization, combining a dedicated administrative office (OIR), a proactive student body (IRC), formal exchange programs, and dedicated financial support, indicates that global engagement is a core strategic priority for IIT Kharagpur. This focus is not merely for academic enrichment but is a deliberate effort to elevate the institute's global standing, enhance the learning experience, and equip its graduates with the cross-cultural competencies required to succeed in a globalized world.

## **Part VII: Campus Life and Student Welfare**

### **7.0 Campus Infrastructure and Facilities**

The sprawling 2,100-acre campus of IIT Kharagpur is a self-contained township that provides a comprehensive range of academic, residential, and recreational facilities for its community of over 16,000 students.3

* **Central Library:** The Central Library is one of the largest technical libraries in Asia. Established in 1951, it houses a collection of over 350,000 books and documents, subscribes to more than 1,600 printed journals, and provides IP-based access to over 40,000 e-journals and 20,000 e-books.1 The library operates from 8 AM to 12 Midnight on all days and remains open 24/7 during examination periods to support students' academic needs. It is also the host institution for the  
  **National Digital Library of India (NDLI)** project, a Ministry of Education initiative to create a virtual repository of learning resources.79  
* **Residential Life:** The institute is fully residential, with 21 Halls of Residence—16 for boys and 5 for girls—that accommodate the entire student body.77 These halls are equipped with amenities such as high-speed LAN, Wi-Fi, and 24-hour electricity. Each hall has its own mess and canteen facilities.82  
* **Healthcare Facilities:** The **B.C. Roy Technology Hospital**, located on campus, serves as the primary healthcare provider for the IIT Kharagpur community. It offers 24/7 emergency services, an Out-Patient Department (OPD), and various specialized clinics, including Gynaecology, Psychiatry, and Paediatrics.77  
* **Student Activities and Festivals:** Campus life is vibrant, with a rich tradition of student-run activities and festivals that are among the largest in India.  
  * **Spring Fest:** Established in 1960, Spring Fest is the annual social and cultural festival of IIT Kharagpur. It is one of the oldest and largest college festivals in India, attracting participants from over 150 colleges. The festival features over 130 events across genres like music, dance, dramatics, and literature, and is renowned for its "Pro-Nights" (Star-Nites) which host concerts by major national and international artists.85  
  * **Kshitij:** This is the annual techno-management fest, recognized as one of the largest of its kind in Asia. Kshitij organizes over 40 events, competitions with significant prize money, exhibitions showcasing cutting-edge technology, and workshops conducted by tech giants like Google and Apple.

### **7.1 Recent Student Welfare Initiatives**

In 2025, IIT Kharagpur faced a significant crisis following a series of student suicides, which brought the issue of mental health and student well-being to the forefront of the institute's priorities.90 In response, the administration launched a series of new, high-profile initiatives aimed at creating a more supportive and vigilant campus environment.

* **HEART (Help, Empower and Resiliently Thrive) Program:** Launched in July 2025, this is a two-pronged program.  
  1. **AI-Driven Wellness App:** An all-in-one mobile application designed to serve as a first point of contact for students. It features a chat service for preliminary emotional expression, helps students navigate campus resources (hostel, department, medical facilities), and uses AI-driven analytics to provide the administration with insights into the overall mental health trends on campus.92  
  2. **"Campus Mothers" Program:** This community engagement initiative involves female campus residents (staff or family members of staff) volunteering to provide a "human touch" and emotional support to students. Volunteers undergo an orientation program conducted by trained psychologists to understand boundaries and their role. The program aims to de-stigmatize seeking help and provide a more accessible, informal support system.93  
* **SETU (Support, Empathy, Transformation, and Upliftment) Program:** This wellness program provides students with access to professional mental health support, including 24/7 online counseling and one-on-one therapy sessions with trained professionals and peer groups.93  
* **Hostel Wing Task Force:** This is a student-led peer support and vigilance system. Students in each hostel wing are organized into four teams, with each team being active on a weekly rotational basis. The members of the task force are expected to act as the "eyes and ears of the hostels," being vigilant of their peers, noticing any behavioral changes, and alerting hall authorities for timely intervention. This initiative is designed to increase student participation and foster a culture of shared responsibility for each other's well-being.78

The rapid launch of these diverse initiatives—combining technology, community engagement, professional counseling, and peer monitoring—demonstrates a decisive administrative response to a critical situation. However, this multi-pronged approach has not been without scrutiny. The "Campus Mothers" program, in particular, has drawn criticism from mental health professionals regarding its gendered nature, which excludes male volunteers, and raises ethical concerns about the screening, training, and ability of volunteers to maintain confidentiality and provide non-judgmental support.92 Similarly, the peer task force model, while promoting a sense of community, could be perceived as a form of surveillance if not implemented with extreme care and sensitivity.

This period represents a significant institutional challenge for IIT Kharagpur. The effectiveness of these new programs in fostering a genuinely supportive environment, rather than one of mandated intervention, will be a critical determinant of their success and will likely serve as a case study for other higher education institutions in India grappling with similar issues of student mental health.

### **7.2 Conclusion**

The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, as the progenitor of the IIT system, continues to uphold its legacy of academic and research excellence. Its strategic evolution from a focused technical institute to a comprehensive university has broadened its appeal and impact, while its deep-rooted heritage provides a unique institutional identity centered on national service. The institute's robust academic framework, characterized by a flexible and interdisciplinary curriculum, produces highly sought-after graduates, a fact consistently validated by its resilient and impressive placement outcomes. Furthermore, its structured research ecosystem, which provides a clear pathway from fundamental inquiry to commercial innovation, positions it as a key contributor to India's technological advancement.

However, the institute is not without its challenges. The recent, tragic student deaths have exposed critical vulnerabilities in student well-being, compelling the administration to rapidly deploy a suite of new welfare initiatives. While these actions demonstrate a commitment to addressing the crisis, their long-term success will depend on careful implementation, professional oversight, and the cultivation of a genuine culture of trust and support. As IIT Kharagpur moves forward, its ability to navigate this complex issue while sustaining its academic and research momentum will be a defining feature of its next chapter. The institute's journey continues to be a benchmark for higher education in India, embodying both the immense potential and the profound responsibilities of a premier institution of national importance.
