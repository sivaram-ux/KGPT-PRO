## **II. Introduction to IIT Kharagpur's Academic Structure**

### **Overview of IIT Kharagpur's Academic Landscape**

The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, established in 1951, stands as a preeminent public/government institution in India.\[1\] Its foundational ethos, "योगः कर्मसु कौशलम्" (Excellence in action is Yoga), underscores a deep commitment to national service through diligent work and high achievement.\[2, 3\] The institute offers a comprehensive spectrum of academic programs, spanning undergraduate (UG), postgraduate (PG), and doctoral levels.\[1, 2, 4, 5\] These offerings encompass a diverse range of degrees, including Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.), Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.), various Dual Degree programs, Joint M.Sc.-Ph.D., Integrated M.Sc., and the recently introduced B.Sc.-B.Ed. Integrated Teacher Education Programme (ITEP).\[2\] At the postgraduate level, programs such as Master of Technology (M.Tech.), Master of City Planning (MCP), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Executive MBA (EMBA), Master of Human Resource Management (MHRM), Master of Medical Science and Technology (MMST), Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA), Master of Public Policy, Law and Governance (MPPLG), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) are available.\[2\] The information compiled within this report reflects the most current curriculum details, primarily derived from the Autumn Semester (2025–2026) Central Time Table \[6\] and specific ERP curriculum pages, with updates as recent as July 15, 2025.\[6\]

### **Curriculum Nomenclature and Structure**

The curriculum at IIT Kharagpur employs a standardized nomenclature for course credits, typically expressed in an L-T-P format (Lecture-Tutorial-Practical). This format precisely indicates the weekly hours allocated to each component of a course. For example, a 3-1-0 credit structure denotes 3 hours of lectures, 1 hour of tutorials, and 0 hours of practical sessions per week. The total credits assigned to a course are derived from this L-T-P breakdown. Courses are broadly categorized by subject type, which includes "Core" subjects (mandatory foundational or specialization-specific courses essential for the program), "Elective" subjects (optional courses students can choose from a defined list), "Breadth Elective" subjects (courses designed to broaden a student's knowledge base beyond their primary discipline), and "Depth Elective" subjects (specialized courses within or closely related to the student's main field of study). These classifications are consistently applied and explicitly noted in the curriculum documentation where such details are provided.\[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23\]

### **Data Currency and Limitations**

The primary source for the curriculum details presented in this report is the "Central Time Table Autumn Semester (2025 – 2026)" \[6\], which was last updated on July 15, 2025.\[6\] Additional information regarding the 2025-2026 academic year is corroborated by other institutional and third-party sources.\[1, 2, 4, 24, 25, 26\] It is important to note that the provided research material does not contain "previous course pages" or historical curriculum data, thereby limiting the scope of this analysis to the current and upcoming academic sessions as per the user's request. Furthermore, specific data gaps for certain programs, where detailed course-level information (course IDs, L-T-P, credits, and subject types) was not explicitly available in the provided ERP snippets, will be highlighted within their respective departmental sections.

The explicit labeling of "New Curricula – 2024" for foundational years and the distinct "Curricula – 2021" for later years in the Autumn Semester (2025–2026) Time Table \[6\] suggests that IIT Kharagpur has recently undertaken, and is likely continuing, a substantial curriculum revision process. This is not merely a static course catalog but rather a reflection of active academic development and adaptation. The presence of different curriculum versions for various academic years indicates a dynamic and responsive educational environment, where the institution is committed to keeping its programs current and aligned with contemporary demands. This ongoing modernization effort may be in response to evolving industry needs, advancements in various fields, or national educational policies such as the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which is referenced in the context of the Integrated Teacher Education Programme.\[27, 28\] For academic researchers or educational consultants, this signifies an institution that is actively shaping its offerings to remain relevant and competitive in the higher education landscape.

Notes on Departmental Structure:  
The research materials indicate that "Environmental Science and Engineering" exists as a "School" \[31\] and is listed as an entity offering degrees.\[30\] However, the detailed course-level curriculum provided for "Environmental Engineering and Management" is explicitly housed under "Civil Engineering" (CE3) within the ERP system.\[23, 29\] Additionally, a general undergraduate course, "Environmental Science" (EV10003), is mentioned as a Depth CORE subject in the Integrated M.Sc. Chemistry curriculum, carrying 2-0-0 L-T-P and 2 credits.\[18, 32\] This course also appears in an NPTEL course description as a 3-credit undergraduate core offering.\[25\] This suggests a foundational environmental science course is integrated across various engineering and science disciplines within the institute.  
The observation that the user query specifically asks for "Environmental Science and Engineering" as a department, while the detailed M.Tech. curriculum for "Environmental Engineering and Management" is found under the "Civil Engineering" department in the ERP system, points to a nuanced organizational structure at IIT Kharagpur.\[23, 29\] This arrangement suggests that academic "Schools" may function as distinct entities for overarching academic oversight and research, while their specific degree programs, particularly at the postgraduate level, might be administratively or curriculum-wise housed within established "Departments" (such as Civil Engineering) for operational efficiency. This could be attributed to the historical evolution of programs, the sharing of faculty expertise, or optimized resource allocation. For external stakeholders, this highlights the importance of understanding the internal academic governance and interdepartmental collaborations at IIT Kharagpur. It implies that a program's name might not always directly map to its administrative "home" department, necessitating a deeper investigation into the institute's internal structure. This model allows for specialized schools to leverage the foundational strengths and resources of larger, established departments, fostering interdisciplinary synergy and a more comprehensive approach to complex fields like environmental engineering.
