## CodeClub IIT KGP just embarrassed the whole college on Codeforces

### Description
Recently, CodeClub from IIT Kharagpur hosted a ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù Codeforces contest. You‚Äôd expect a well-organized event that reflects the coding culture of one of India‚Äôs top institutes.
But what actually happened? A ranklist full of newbies magically solving every problem ‚Äî people who usually struggle with Div 2 A were suddenly performing like LGMs. Peak character development, I guess.
And while all this ‚Äúmiraculous growth‚Äù was unfolding, not a single Master, CM, or GM bothered to give the contest.
It‚Äôs honestly pathetic. The club that‚Äôs supposed to represent KGP‚Äôs CP scene ended up exposing how little they care about fairness or actual skill. Instead of building credibility, they just handed the community a reason to laugh at us.
And let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî some of those submissions were so suspiciously fast and accurate, it felt less like a contest and more like a synchronized solution reveal.¬†
Good job, CodeClub. You didn‚Äôt just mess up a contest ‚Äî you made sure everyone remembers IIT KGP for all the wrong reasons. Shame

the worst part is he isnt guilty of cheating but justifying his prompting skills

**2.** "The club that‚Äôs supposed to represent KGP‚Äôs CP scene ended up exposing how little they care about fairness or actual skill.¬†"
CP here without fullform is so damn funny out of context

Interesting

**4.** I took the contest and to be honest the problems were a little unusual but they certainly weren't bad per se (except maybe problem A). B was really hard in some sense the logic works without considering two balls can hit eachother but why does it work is hard to prove, by considering test cases it is possible to find the answer. I was close to solving C (found the answer bound for working m but couldn't find the construction of the graph within the time limit).
I can usually solve div2 B's and I performed as expected (additionally with some good progress in C).
People are hating because:
1) The flavour-text of problems are kind of annoying
2) Solutions are easily found by gpt apparently (B and D had an insane amount of solves in very less time)
3) The organizers were not very high rated.
4) The problems were certainly not your usual cp problems.
5) There are suspicions that solutions have been leaked.
Some amount of hate is justified but remember this isn't just portraying KGP's image itself but rather the whole of India. If you read the comments you'll know what I mean. I'm not really sure if only blaming the organizers is the right call since the \\*\\*herd mentality\\*\\* of cheating and fraud us Indians have is extremely concerning and today it was exposed internationally (definitely not the first time).

**5.** Average dumbass opinion. It's not the problem-setters' responsibility to ensure that there is no cheating. The problems themselves were pretty good imo.
Over to the suspicions of leaked questions, none of them have any evidence.¬†
Stop blaming the authors before you have some experience in the field

**6.** https://preview.redd.it/7h8doivgdb8f1.jpeg?width=545&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b142215d13deb71f4367a0df9696e72ac3fdcc27
Codenite üëèüëè

**7.** The excessive cheating by using AI is not directly not the problem setters fault. The problem set was genuinely good just that the recent newer models were capable of solving most of the problems easily. The chances are very high a lot of upcoming contests will have the same result. It's not the problem setters but the many participants from kgp and other Indian institutes who ruined our reputation.(Inda already had a very bad image on cf but it just got way more worse)

**8.** https://preview.redd.it/p9aykmhu5g8f1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=125ec8de225ac3bf3f8be6937a118d1713b8b37c

**9.** WOW what a fking joke, even the top students are cheating, leave merit itself seems to be dead, all seem to be zombies using chatgpt.

**10.** Which exam today can truly claim to be free from cheating? From JEE Mains/Advance to end-semester, mid-semester, and job entrance exams ‚Äî cheating is happening everywhere. It's time we start learning to live with it. This is the harsh reality, and no one can stop it. Long live GPT!

**1.** Key point to note: Ensure that from the moment you call an ambulance to the time an actual doctor sees you in BC Roy, the response time is the same for all hostels and is low enough so that no one dies. This type of incident happened a couple of years ago, when, due to a delay in reaching Kolkata after being referred by BC Roy, someone died.
I am sure the person responsible for posting from the KGP account on LinkedIn and Facebook is already searching for the name, pic, and department of this student to replace in the already existing template.

**2.** There needs to be seriously actions
Or bodies just keep dropping like flies

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** it‚Äôs tragic to see a suicide more so you had to find via posting on Reddit. Back in our days a Suicide equates to mass protests , diro being pulled up and questioned , closure of depts work. legit the then diro cried on stage to gain sympathy.

**2.** 5 suicides within 6 months... that's worrisome. Why kgp students are so depressed?? They need to understand that this is inflation period in India that's why it's hard to get job with good package. It's okay to struggle for few years to get a worth it job. Don't keep high hopes from yourself & don't let your parents expect unimaginable success from you.... that truly kills the passion & willpower. Just go with the flow and study well without thinking about the results. You will get successful eventually at some point of time in your life. Don't be in hurry.

**3.** Guys you know what...all the seniors in this sub no matter how fucked your life was please motivate your juniors be it mtech btech phd...Being lively and giving hope to your juniors doesn't make them delusional and nor does it make you unsuccesful I didnt get placed from an isro college(iist if cg>7.5 direct isro job)but i had seniors who told me that its okay and i shouldnt worry about job or life as long as i stay true to my studies and have fun but sadly majority people here think of sports, cultural activites as a burden. Help your juniors make networks, don't fucking demotivate someone from doing something extra curricular just because you don't have the capability to not do anything other than academics.
I am so sorry for that guy...Imagine being a graduate of one of the top 5 iit and still not having self belief and it's not his fault and it's not a suicide it's murder.
Rip.

**4.** It's high time to bring back DC++..

**5.** Why does this happen so often in iit kgp
Sorry if I sound rude

**6.** 3rd yr guy suicided.

**7.** Kgp administration has always been shit‚Ä¶
all it takes is mandatory personal counselling sessions with a therapist for every student‚Ä¶ or atleast evaluations & screenings to keep a tab.. professional help can go a long way to change lives of the students.
I was a student there once‚Ä¶ & if only I had a professional help to discuss my problems It would have helped me ton in making my life so much better.

**8.** [removed]

**9.** Damn! I feel sad for these people who take their own life nobody knows the perfect reason but giving away your life, rather than giving yourself time. It‚Äôs just very awful. I‚Äôm just thinking how his parents might be going through right now.

**10.** suicide?

**1.** I see a confusion in this comment section where people are under impression that this "debate" has a communal angle, which is not true. Attaching the link to the full article -
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-kharagpurs-convocation-dress-code-sparks-debate/articleshow/104956392.cms
Thanks to u/BrownMidget for reading the whole article and summarizing it here!

**2.** I don't think people are hating the traditional dress code. From just reading the dress code it seems like they are just being tooo specific and that's why there's debate.
I think if its just " wear a formal white kurta or saree appropriate to the occassion". It would've been fine?
Like I as a person won't wear a cotton saree again but I can get a white kurta and wear it multiple times? I don't want to buy a white saree that is sooo specific. If I buy a white saree, I would like it to have like a really nice golden zari pallu.
If you want things to be so particular, provide the costumes on rent or something.

**3.** Yea this sounds fucking horrible. Why in the world is it so specific??? Its a celebration for the students yar, don't make it so boring

**4.** Lmaooooo what‚Äôs even the issue here. Also how does it spark debate when IIT-K does it but not another college like IIIT-H. Sure it‚Äôs a pain in the butt to get good quality kurtas these days, but how can you not find them more comfortable than stuff like suits?

**5.** What no Khaki chaddi as well?

**6.** It‚Äôs difficult to handle cotton sarees! Plus, if not draped well, it tends to bulge and make you look fat!
Atleast plain georgette sarees allow karna chahiye imo!

**7.** CONTEXT TIME!
Since the entire article isn‚Äôt posted here, maybe because Print media doesn‚Äôt have it‚Ä¶let me be the Lord and Saviour Dr.Context:
So surprisingly, a pleasant one that is, it is NOT COMMUNALLY MOTIVATED NOR DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WEARING WHITE ON AN AUSPICIOUS OCCASION.
The entire debate is because several LGBTQ folks feel that ‚ÄúDress codes curbs ‚ÄòPersonal freedom and choice‚Äô‚Äù and that it is not inclusive and regressive of them to force people into ‚ÄòBoys‚Äô and ‚ÄòGirls‚Äô like in case of Non-Binary folks. Which has led to many such students to boycott the function altogether.
The other point being made is that the dress is so particular and specific that it is difficult for students, especially those with limited means, to get these items specially for a single occasion.
I do not want to start any sort of a slugfest here but I personally feel that there should be a general uniform colour but dressing style and specific accessories should not be mandated.
EDIT: I am not a student at IIT-KGP nor am I smart enough to even be on this sub, let alone a college as good as IIT-KGP!

**8.** so the "white" colour code in our culture is generally only worn on someone's death and diwali is a festival so that might be the reason

**9.** One of the happiest days of your life and you dress up for a funeral.

**10.** Dk why people hate their own culture so much and are ashamed about it. This doesn't even have a religious undertone.

**2.** [deleted]

**3.** If something like this happens, it becomes a debate topic among my friends as to why such things only happen in KGP. Someone needs to do a concrete case study on this matter. Is KGP truly cursed? Or do the suicides at other IITs not come to light?

**4.** Ho gaya bhai. Bass itna hee institute kar sakta hai. Template mein photoframe badal sakta hain iss se jyada kuch nahi, Tata bye bye. Aise abhi kitne aur marenge tab bhi ye hijli detention camp waisa ka waisa bana rahega.

**6.** Passed out in 2022! One year was closed due to Covid, had 6 suicides of students in an academic year when STUDENTS WERE STAYING AT THEIR HOME. One a classmate!
Just heart wrenching to see young lives go by. Administration wont do anything.
We are as everyone say,"IN THE SERVICE OF THE NATION".

**1.** Students hi chutiya hai Hall Tempo ke naam pe kuch bhi kar dete hai (especially to second years)

**2.** L\*nd bsdk kuch hoga. Ye professor, randi ke saale inka accent samajh aata nahi. Padhayenge ye jhaant bhar assignment denge MIT wala. Bsdk kuch padha toh do phir assignment do toh theek lagta hai par nahi. Aur attendance inn bhadwo ko chahiye 80%, din bhar labour cycle bhaanjo 5-6km, phir upar se G\*ndu pressure din raat ye project wo launda ye lahsun yahi karo aur ek din mar jaao Tatti sa khaana khaake, yahi hai jindagi. Aur yahaan ka weather bhi lund hai intense garmi phir barish phir garmi phir barish. Jh\*\*nt ka IIT hai ye. Aise hee sabhi hai Koi nayi baat nahi hai. India ka best technical institute l\*nd mera.

**3.** Why is the administration trying to do everything other than invest in mental health resources?
Do students have any other job besides forming a task force? Already, there are numerous societies, GC events, and academics to worry about now. Jobs are hard to get, now this? The entire campus mothers' thing is delegating work to women on campus, and the task force is delegating it to students. Could you give this job to the people who are capable of doing it?
Hire a large number of young psychologists and mental health professionals across the spectrum of issues encountered by students. Also, ensure that these new hires are aware of the reality on campus so that they can provide informed advice. Offer choices to students who need help, and they will take advantage of them. People with regressive mentality in the counseling center saying "Acads pe dhyan do" and "everything will be okay" will not work.

**4.** Inko prevent hi karna hai, kyu bacche kar rahe hai usse kuch lena dena nahi.
And ye last year se hi hai, wingrep ke name se

**5.** This is a welcome step. Along with this, please consider appointing mental health experts for each hall for the next couple of months. Once students begin to realize the importance of mental health, they will start approaching the central authorities on their own. You could also build a small application for wing representatives to regularly update and inform the authorities. The wing rep should check in with their wingmates on a regular basis initially weeklly basis and if any behavioral changes are observed in a wingmates, it should be immediately uploaded into the system. This will save time and enable faster action.
There are many things a wing rep can monitor and report through the app to help in the early identification of concerns. The application can include a feature such as an LLM-based model that allows students to have initial discussions, with the option for an expert to intervene if needed. (This could even evolve into a startup idea by offering the app to other colleges. Abhi ke liye excel based system banaya ja sakta hai , Many can question wing rep ke pas sala aur koi kaam nahi hai , bhai aesa hai this POR is better than other dummy POR, here u r actually playing with data , understanding emotional /behavioural data and intelligence ...all will help u in long run ....akale institute kuch nahi kar paayega ....

**6.** Isn't this a old news? Cuz I have been wing rep last year and did nothing literally except cake khareedna...none of our seniors bothered to assign tasks lol I somehow feel they forgot our existence üò¥

**7.** This was discussed in the previous meeting and the summary was
Anything involving students or profs can be manipulated to give desired results

**8.** Hire therapists, do campaigns and spread mental health awareness ‚ùåÔ∏è
Hire Campus Mommies and form random groups, random for show bakchodi ‚úÖÔ∏è

**9.** Just show off, it will continue for a few months until everyone forgets and then the cycle repeats, not that I want one to begin with

**10.** Happens every goddamn year tbh, meanwhile dugc maa chuda rahi hogi apni

## Vinayak Lohani, an alumnus of IIT Kharagpur has been announced to be the receipt of Padma Shree this year for his contribution in social service. Sharing an article on him below.

**Flair:** KGP News üì∞

**Author:** u/None

[Post Link](https://i.redd.it/7m9a7xggvkfe1.jpeg)

### Description
Vinayak Lohani. Does India know about him? Does the name sound familiar? If the answer is yes, it‚Äôs nice. But if it‚Äôs no, then the Indian society should indulge in some serious introspection.
Bhopal (MP)-born Lohani had set foot on Bengal soil as a student to study at IIT Kharagpur and then IIM Kolkata. Course completed; but unlike his peers, this ‚Äòfool‚Äô didn‚Äôt strive for a glamorous, lucrative top corporate career in India or abroad to earn a fortune and live life king size. Despite being in the mid-40s, he hasn‚Äôt engaged himself in a matrimonial bond as well; yet this man is father to thousands of children.
Is it a fable or merely a dream? No, it is a hard fact which is stranger than fiction.
As stated previously, Lohani refrained from engaging in a rat race to turn successful career-wise. Instead, this Vivekananda-Mother Teresa inspired person, taking diksha at the Ramkrishna Mission, opted out of career placement after completing his MBA and, as a true human being, he turned his attention towards the plight of the orphan and poor children loitering at railway platforms and red-light areas, left to their own wretched mercy by the state and all apparatus of society.
By giving tuitions and lectures to MBA aspirants, Lohani rented a tiny accommodation, established his own organisation, Parivaar, in 2003, and took up the responsibility of sheltering feeding and educating three helpless children. But expenditure was far exceeding the income through tuitions. But drawing inspiration from his selfless Himalayan task, IIM alumni and like-minded, compassionate acquaintances came up with donations which have enabled Lohani to come up with an independent building, comprising a school and a hostel spread over more than 20 acres and housing more than 1,000 orphans or children of the poorest of the poor families. Many of them have completed their graduation and are retained in the hostel itself, giving tuitions to the younger batches and can move out only when they get ready to face the world independently.
What an act of protective father to thousands who were doomed to lead the whole of their lives as beggars or, at best, manual labourers, or could have been victims of traffickers and ended up as petty criminals or prostitutes.
It is high time India learned to identify its true heroes and role models and offered a helping hand to these faceless Vinayak Lohanis, so that they can pursue their goals with more success. The authorities concerned should also learn from Lohani about their foremost duties and priorities and at first take up the cause of India‚Äôs vulnerable children, instead of remaining immersed in playing to the gallery of statues film festivals, bullet trains, temple, or religion.

**4.** and all the narayanmurthys and premjis cldnt even do one tenth of this inspite of 'donating' crores of rupees

**5.** Feeling proud and motivated

**6.** Yes these news should be highlighted as so many people are barely surviving in India ,they are fighting and working hard just for their survival and people discuss about nonsense nowadays. Everyone should understand the need to help others and give back to society as much as they can

**7.** IAS 's son opening an NGO so that people can make 'donations'. Yep. Not suspicious at all. It's not like donating gives you a tax write off or anything right? Y'all are so gullible lmaoooo eating this shit right up

## Fight Club at IIT KGP?

### Description
Yesterday some of my friends and I were out for a night out. We came across a very strange activity happening at the new construction building behind SBP Hall. There were around 6‚Äì7 men standing in a circle, and two of them were fighting in the middle. All of them were shirtless. It was around 2 AM, and because of the dim light, we couldn‚Äôt see their faces clearly it was mostly dark. The guys were cheering and fighting aggressively like some event is going on. They looked like students, around the usual age of KGP students.
They caught our attention, and one of them called out to us, saying ‚ÄúOye, idhar aao sab‚Ä¶ come here‚Äù Then the others also started calling us. We got really scared and quickly rode away from that place on our cycles. We tried to take a video too, but everything happened so quickly that we didn‚Äôt get enough time, and everyone was holding their cycles.
P.S.: We were not dr\*\*k neither high.

## Pseudoscience and Kgp

**Author:** u/Careless-Secret-3893

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/178fn2j/pseudoscience_and_kgp/)

### Description
Despite being a science and technology institute, why are there so many followers of 'gurus' like Sadhguru who propagate pseudoscience all the time? And it's not just students, even some of the professors are ready to accept all the BS? What's going wrong exactly?

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** I think the best way to look at it is, people aren't looking for scientific research in Sadhguru, they are mostly looking for emotional/spiritual answers, and almost any answer to it will just happen to be unscientific unless it is something that can be better explained through psychology

**2.** Amritkaal ka Prasaad samajh kar ignore Karo.

**3.** "Religion without Science is Blind. Science without religion is lame"- Albert Einstein.
I prefer to use the word 'faith' for the word 'religion' in the next few sentences.
'Faith' is not a bad thing. Faith can be very powerful in our everyday life. Faith can keep a man fighting even though he knows the war is lost. Rationality doesn't work everywhere. Miracles do happen. That's the truth.
And successful 'gurus' rely mostly on philosophical discussions, rather than pure religious preachings.
If you watch one video of Sadhguru's on youtube, you could have a very tiny view out of the whole picture. Sadhguru usually talks philosophy, art of living, state of mind etc. Sometimes he gets ahead of himself and ventures into science. It is a business at the end of the day. He has successfully built a business.
But most things he say make sense. He preaches mindfulness, detachment, self realization etc. Some teachings even overlap with the teachings of Buddha. Maybe your peers and professors are paying heed to those philosophical discussions, which could actually be helpful.
So, even though its a business, as long as the consumer gets value for his money, its a success.
You should look at the whole picture.

**4.** You‚Äôre mixing practical knowledge with very limited application in real life on a daily living basis , to something that‚Äôs for the living lifestyle and mind,body and soul.

**5.** Don‚Äôt think India cares much for scientific thinking. The purpose of science in India is to use it for personal gains like job/Money .. also india there is widespread tribal belief ingrained in society that our ancient society had advanced scientific knowledge . Granted that some were rational like school of nyaya /advaita etc but each needs to be examined for it‚Äôs scientific and rational validity. Some old Indian guy wrote it alone doesn‚Äôt make it scientific and true .
I remember there was a rumor that mangalyan had the nimbu mirchi thread .
I support op and share his concern in the sense these things should not be encouraged by the institute . Someone can do an event and invite sadhguru but the Insti shouldn‚Äôt be supporting it and make it official .
But then what to talk of the Insti who published a pseudo scientific calendar .

**6.** That's human psychology. Have been existing from time immemorial.

**7.** r/scienceisdope
Answer this

**8.** All these Gurus always target kids in engineering college. Because these kids are really proud of being from a science background, with most never internalizing the scientific methodology. (The latter applies to most people, but the fake sense of being science-y makes the indoctrination easier)
It's the best audience to be baptized into believing random stuff to be "scientific", based on unrelated jargon.
\*\*Source\*\*: I have been part of such organizations during my college days, in a NIT. And have seen these patterns working on me and others, some more than others.
This is also an age, where you would pretty much do anything, to be part of a group. So that also helps.
It's mostly harmless, unless people go too deep into the pseudo-science part. And most people grow out of it. They are either not too involved, or get too involved, and see the stupidities and tricks behind the facade.
These are religious cults, just like religious cults of any other religion. And cults are never good for the common members.

**9.** There was a video, I think by Science is dope, that said "we are not taught how to think scientifically but rather to do just do scientific things".
And it stands true for any course in India. We lack critical and scientific thinking because we are never promoted or taught to do so.
Even in school, we are told to just remember and never understand. Hence why the presence of science and religion simultaneously in our country.

**10.** Teach science in a manner compatible with culture . Culture and religion are the main part of your identity and if something is presented as a challenge to itand people cannot falsify it , they try to ignore it . It was not so with early scholars of India .
People to associate themselves with science . For instance , Mohan had 8 apples , he sold 5 then how many were left with him , is a dull way to teach students , try writing it ways questions were framed in the book of mathematics Leelavati , where playful imagery and a bit of poetry is used .

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** Of course they don't care just like the students here in KGP, for them it's just a little inconvenience which they will overcome in a matter of days through some email shit post and a candle march to portray how devastated they are, which they aren't clearly.

**2.** Admin couldn't even take the time to proof read his email. Wrote 2024 instead of 2025.

**3.** Admin ko pata hai har saal hona ek toh suicide kamsekam.. why bother to write a unique email?

**4.** [deleted]

**5.** Tbh I don't know why they even care to send a mail.
They don't even say anything substantial in it. It's all just air talk

**6.** I have beed a student of kgp from 2016 to 2021. In our time there were many suicides like this. Our institute just never show seriousness in these matters. For them this also have become a routine job, cleaning up mess after a suicide. They are never compassionate about it and neither they take any essential steps to do anything about student's mental health and wellbeing. Its a shame that our college is known to be the suicide capital among other IITs.

As you are coming to IIT Kharagpur. First of all Congratulations guys even if you didn't get the branch you wanted this is in no means a tiny achievement. Do remember that your dept is not everything, anyone with ample skills can compete with higher dept students. Having said that I want to highlight some points I want to tell
In IIT-
1. Dont stay in the room, Go outside make new friends, not all friendships last but the experience is unforgettable
2. Explore societies and your hobbies as you'll have a lot of time, Don't stress too much on acads.
3. Explore all the places in our huge campus, Visit Netaji auditorium for weekend movies
4. Go out with friends, Visit Kolkata, Digha and all
5. All in all don't forget that you will always have someone to talk to and someone to go when you feel low. If that someone is not your batchmate let that someone be a senior. Make sure that you'll also be there to atleast listen to you friends' hardships.
Make these 4 years the best 4 years of your life!!

**1.** no 2 is the most stupid advice given and propagated by senior through out time and its sad to see the same continuing even now.

**2.** Kolkata jaana allowed hai like nightout pe and shit?

If the executives ( countries top scholars and academicians) can't control the administration , it's better to transfer the administration to the bureaucrats.Rather hand it over to the military.

### Description
I finally completed 5 long years at IIT Kgp. I did fairly good in acads. But now I feel I did wrong by joining IIT. Everyone here is so much ambitious and want to do something good in life. Here I am with no ambition at all. I just want a low profile life and peace. I believe it's not wrong in thinking like that. Just a advice for juniors. If you are like me don't join IIT just because you are good in acads. If you dream big and want to achieve it, IIT is very good platform. But if you want a simple life it's not for you. Don't just fall victims of relatives and parents expectations. I know as a 18 yr old it's difficult to understand these but I wish I could go back in time and told myself not to get in this rat race. Now coming back to the point. If you get IIT degree, people will start having high expectations which will start to eat you up. So think a little what you want or how you want to see yourself in future and do that only. Just because someone got high package doesn't mean you have to chase for it. Just do what you want. For me it's leading a simple peaceful life. But I don't know how to achieve that. Because I always did what others did without even thinking what I want. 

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** Feeling the same way after 2 years. Grinded for JEE and joined KGP for my parents will, got OENA which I am clueless about and still don't know what I really want to do while all my friends have a clear vision.
Everyday I wake up and wonder what am I doing in my life ? and just procrastinate and go to bed at night and days pass but still no clear vision. Sometimes I wonder why am I doing this ?
And in the end I don't have an answer,
nor the will to find it for...

**2.** Life ka vision dhundhne mein zindagi nikal jati hain logon ki. You gotta let things flow and see how things unfold. If one doesn't know what to do then they should keep on doing what has been proven to be good for others in general, till they realise what actually makes them happy.

**3.** Don't worry Op one day you will also have clear vision
You were meant to get in iit

**4.** dw. 20-30 is like this only. everyone is searching what they really want. it gets a lil chaotic at 25-26 when you realise you're becoming a grandpa as well XD
I did my M.tech from here so kinda had to lock-in career wise but from my ug the only regret I have is not going on any trips and outings (parents didn't allow).
Even right now am so bored ambition wise, although I've an international trip lined up in june, and then convocation in july, and I'll get the offer/joining letter by that time, so a lot to look forward to. but I kind of miss the grind as it gave some purpose.

**5.** I think why to have vision this fast
If you are confused about what things to do
Just start anything new to learn. Might later you will get your vision

**6.** It's not your fault, bro it's a flaw in our society. People believe that having money means having everything, but that‚Äôs far from the truth. Sure, you need a basic amount of money to live a comfortable and happy life. But in our generation, everyone seems to be chasing money instead of pursuing what genuinely brings them joy.
In India, parents often want their children to get into IITs, AIIMS, the defence forces, civil services, or other government jobs. From a young age, they create an environment of pressure, making it seem like cracking a certain exam is the only path to success.
In school, we're taught that good grades will get us into a good college, and a good college will land us a high-paying job as if that's the only formula for a successful life. My case is also similar to this , but right now we can't do anything except finding what actually bring us joy. All you have to do is keep your childhood inside you alive, make your thinking curious about your surroundings as it was in your childhood. Try new things and soon you'll find your way of living your life.

**7.** Don't worry you will achieve greater heights in life than those ambitious but shallow people.

**8.** You can still join a PSU and live the life you want.

**9.** I think why to have vision this fast
If you are confused about what things to do
Just start anything new to learn. Might later you will get your vision

**10.** Why to have a clear vision this much fast
Learn and develop any skill and master it
Later you can find your vision of life

## Why was(is?) kgp internet so restricted ?

### Description
Even apps like WhatsApp do not work inside campus, many websites are banned. I was wondering what might be the reason for this ?

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** Piracy sites are all banned but idk about whatsapp. Even for whatsapp, guest secured does allow it. Also, sites with poor security are banned because if the net connected with them, it might get our campus computers hacked, and we have important information.
For those saying we don't have any important information, do remember that as a government organization, kgp profs contribute to many military and space projects. Infact, the large network outage during last summer right before(or during, I don't exactly remember the timing) endesms was due to a hacking attempt from Pakistan

**2.** Alum here. The Kgp network is a proxy server based system. Earlier days, we had to manually enter the proxy details while saving the wifi details or while connecting to the Ethernet. Now, It still is a proxy based network but now it‚Äôs automatic in the sense you don‚Äôt have to enter the proxy and port details every time. They ban porn and stuff as that‚Äôs against academia also theoretically porn accounts for most of the internet traffic, so they save on this. THEY DONT BAN WHATSAPP. WhatsApp‚Äôs policy doesn‚Äôt allow/support proxy networks in our 8080 port and hence it just doesn‚Äôt work on our network, not being blocked.

**3.** The reason is/was (according to my network's prof) that they only allowed certain ports on the insti network. That was (I am not sure about this one 80/81). WhatsApp uses different ports to send their packets and hence is blocked.

**4.** Bhai simple reason hai, anything against academia is restricted except reddit. I mean banning WhatsApp and allowing Reddit looks funny to me

**5.** Punishment since the time someone sold that DPS mms from KGP hostel on ebay in 2004 :)

**6.** is valorant/CS banned?

**7.** Pretty much everything is blocked; check the college Discord for the usual bypass methods

**8.** So they can enjoy the night life on campus. Tata steel sports complex can entertain you more than any other things available on the internet.

**9.** Bcoz administrators know how muthal u are

**10.** This is pretty standard. Most companies do this too.

I don't care what anyone thinks but the Student Welfare committee is worst in this institute. How can 4 undergrads with their own acads and work can handle these severe cases?? Also I strongly believe that anyone in this committee is equipped enough to prevent these incidents. What is the counseling centre for? I have seen some counselors who were not following the SOP in Counseling centre. Also in Gymkhana nobody values Students' welfare as the value others. I mean Welfare of the community should be the first priority. A lot of changes have to happen to reduce these kinds of occurrences in the campus

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** At this rate, the institute will end up getting shut down.

**2.** Raise it on Twitter and Facebook.
Let the media know.
There needs to be external pressure

**3.** It's not only counsellors, on Tuesday I went to Deputy Registrar UG for asking a question that "When will my income certificate be verified and if it will take long time then should I apply for late registration?" because I am unable to pay whole fees of 1,50,000 at one time and if my income certificate gets verified then my fees will be revised and it will be reduced.
But the response he gave me traumatized me for a moment he said why haven't you done this 10 days ago ,So I said that I uploaded it in June but it was rejected and then I applied for income certificate in new format so it took time. To this he said " I don't know and you should pay your whole fees and it's up to you to do anything for late registration or not".
I mean what kind of response would you expect after this from a student coming from weak financial background because I also read somewhere that if you don't do subject registration on time then you have to take this semester again next year

**4.** I am an alumnus‚Äîperhaps a little older now‚Äîbut I continue to follow this group closely. Every time I come across such heartbreaking news from campus, it deeply pains me. This time, I felt I must speak up.Often, our first reaction is to blame the institute. But rarely do we pause to ask,
Why did this happen? What can we all do to prevent it?
Yes, there are definite gaps in counseling and student welfare systems. But that‚Äôs only one side of the story.
The other side includes: Love betrayal and emotional distress ,Excessive pressure from parents ,Over-controlling family environments
These are deeply personal challenges that cannot be handled by the institute alone.
To Students:
Please don‚Äôt let temporary pain weaken you. Life is much bigger than any one person, one job, or one failure.
If you don‚Äôt have a BF/GF ‚Äì it‚Äôs okay. There are so many beautiful experiences and people waiting for you.
If you‚Äôve been betrayed ‚Äì move on. Pain fades, and life moves forward.
Job/Internship pressures ‚Äì remember, these are just one part of your journey. There are endless opportunities beyond IIT.
Make real friendships ‚Äì people who support you, listen to you, and grow with you.
Spend time in labs/libraries ‚Äì empower yourself with knowledge. Be so good that even someone like Zuckerberg will come searching for you.
Engage in activities ‚Äì sports, clubs, competitions, and events. Get involved. Stay connected.
To the Institute:
You‚Äôve started many commendable student wellbeing initiatives. But now it‚Äôs time to implement them rapidly and sincerely.
Strengthen the student welfare committees with more resources, trained staff, and authority.
Be vigilant. Launch awareness campaigns so students can report if they see anyone showing signs of mental health issues or behavioral changes.
Bring in mental health experts ‚Äì help students understand emotional wellness, resilience, and coping strategies.
Let‚Äôs remember: no one can solve this alone. It requires collective awareness, empathy, and action.Let‚Äôs stop reacting and start responding ‚Äì together.
For the last few cases, I have come across some possible links. Please read them. Since investigations are still ongoing, I cannot comment on their truthfulness.There is also a hearing going in in the top court related to this, you should follow that too.

Your death in the end doesn't affect you, it affects everyone around you, from your family to your friends or colleagues.

Just the title and it's very sad to encounter two incidents in single academic year
Stay Strong 

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** how many more lives till they close the chapter by labelling it an "unfortunate event", stop students from talking about it, slide it under the bed, and start realising there's a flaw in the system and lack of student body/organisation.
coming from a state govt college, I can tell you there are absolutely no valid circumstances that a student should feel this is the only way left, be it placement pressure, curriculum pressure, socially leftout, prof load. NOTHING
its not okay and definitely a collective failure of kgp administration as a whole. but sadly nothing is going to change.
May his soul rest in peace

**2.** It's high time, we need an open house.
Lavde ka administration hai

**3.** 2 suicides in the same semester :(

**4.** Too much toxicity in the campus among students

**5.** BC, students khud hi toxic hain...bhnchd kaatne mein lge rhte...Jo bol rhe ki administration, bc administration nhi krta chutiyapa...unse zyada students krte

**6.** He was a research guy, dual degree. Checked his linkedIn, pressure from prof might be the reason.

**7.** A terrible news, that could have been avoided.
It's hard to justify why someone would take that step, but at that moment of time, to them, dying seemed the best solution to problems.
The nature of problem or it's intensity/gravity doesn't matter. Some people can handle bigger issues with a smile, for some even small pressures seems too big in their head. It all depends on our upbringing on the kind of environment we grew up in, which makes us emotionally tough or weak.
Every individual is different, however one common thread that ties us all is effective communication. I see all of us are blaming the administration, Profs, Warden, etc. But I fail to see how they are responsible.
Were it the profs who were meeting him everyday, was he having day to day informal interactions with dean or Warden? It was us, his class mates, his neighbor's in hostel, his buddies he used to share his meals with who usually interacted the most with him. Did we not notice change in his behaviour in past few days? Was his body language not different than usual?
Sadly we didn't have the time to notice it. We were too busy on our headphones, watching reels, consuming irrelevant content. Human interactions in IIT Kgp is not adequate. Everyone is too comfortable in their own space, neither do they want others to enter their space nor they intend on entering others and this isn't by design. This happens due to culture that the institute has started following, and for which, we students are responsible.
The issues that I have found in my student life at IIT are:
1. Lack of genuine interactions.
2. Dependable friendships and bonds.
3. Competitiveness.
4. Lack of empathy.
5. Looking inwards.
6. Failing to notice surroundings.
If there's anyone who is responsible for Aniket leaving us soon, it is us, his friends, classmates, hostelmates, kgpians.
The onus of no more suicide in future lies on us, on how attentive we are towards our friend's changing behaviour. Are we able to make him feel comfortable enough to open up to us, is he bringing his problems to us, do we rely on each other?
We can only open our vulnerabilities with someone when we are sure, he/she will not take advantage of it. But have we allowed such comfort level to our friends.
There are many questions we need to answer as students before we can blame the administration. It wasn't their fault. It's been our fault. Hope we will start correcting our mistakes and bring a change in culture.
Thanks.
Zulu

**8.** The name of the guy is Aniket Walkar. Stay strong everyone. Feel free to reach out to me anytime you feel stressed or when things aren't working out. I'll help in any way possible.

**9.** Suicides are becoming normal day by day, the administration and moreover the profs aren't focusing enough on what impact a statement will have on a student. This is very f\*cked up. Imagine living somewhere where someone dies and it isn't something which shocks you anymore. Everyone should be held accountable. The student's profs, fac ads, involved deans, f\*ck it the director too. Also just a small request to everyone, keep an eye out for your friends, call them, talk to them(just like that, no reason), say sorry when you realise you crossed a line when you accidentally say something bad.(I understand it might be cringe and that friends don't need to apologise to each other, but trust me it's needed once in a while). Keep them close, because no-one can imagine the state of their family & friends after they leave.

**10.** Meanwhile Children dying for not being able to be selected in JEE, it all ultimately boils down to mental peace and people around you. Hope he‚Äôs in a better place now, Stay strong guys and do reach out to people whenever you feel the need toüôè

If item is above ‚Çπ200, he reduces like ‚Çπ20 or more. I didn't knew, that even such shops exist in campus. I know blinkit is doing the same job in much easier way, but such shops should exist too.

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** \*\*March\*\* : Current director's term is nearing its end, hence the Ministry of Education and IIT Council gives out an advertisement inviting applications for the post of Director, IIT Khargapur
\*\*June\*\* : A professor from AGFE (The same department that the director belongs to) is appointed as the Deputy Director
\*\*September\*\* : An elected and officially recognised association of IIT KGP Professors writes to the Ministry of Education to exercise caution while appointing the next director, alleging that the outgoing administration flouted a lot of norms/conventions, showed favouritism/nepotism in a lot of appointments instead of merit and overall failed to start a multi-speciality hospital and external campus, which it promised. The letter bore the signatures of a lot of professors and in a nutshell, called the current director an 'incompetent person'.
\*\*November\*\* : IIT KGP Admin asks the 86 professors to show documents and evidence to support their allegations and initiates disciplinary proceedings against the 4 office-bearing professors of the association
\*\*December\*\* : After not reciving a reply, IIT KGP Admin issues a show-cause notice to all professors who signed the joint letter.
The Association asks for further extension of deadline to respond citing ongoing PhD interviews and preparation of Autumn Semester results, which is denied. The Professors hence lodge a protest against the admin.
A Rajya Sabha MP from WB writes to the Minister of Education to escalate the matter.
IIT KGP Admin responds by accusing the rebellious professors of "spreading propaganda" and "maligning the reputation of an Institute of Eminance" inspite of "being a minority of 86 among 800+ faculty members"
The Association writes to the IIT KGP Board Chairman, asking for his intervention in the undemocratic disciplinary proceedings against the rebellious professors.
The Chairman replies by acting as the mediator between the admin and the association in order to de-escalate the matter

**2.** When I met the registrar in kgp , I was like ‚ÄúWho put you in this job‚Äù üòê

TLDR : Search "V K Tewari" in the article

**4.** I heard the director hired someone with an astrophysics background for doing climate research. And that lady is well above 40, that is past the usual age limit for hiring assistant prof. Plus she's dumb as f\*\*k

**5.** Witnessed it live. Also the resignation of TSG President is also because of this right ?

## Corruption at LBS Hall

### Description
Just came across this notice at LBS Hall, and it's absolutely ridiculous. The warden has imposed a ‚Çπ100 fine on every boarder as a penalty for bathroom door damages, without even identifying who is responsible. With around 2000 boarders, this means they are collecting nearly ‚Çπ2 lakhs‚Äîfor bathroom door repairs. Does that even make sense?
Where is this money actually going? This seems like an easy excuse to extract money from students.

Many are blaming BC Roy for inability to save the choking student from Nehru hall. Well, first of all he passed away BEFORE his friends took him to the hospital. At the end, half of the tablet of Augmentein (an antibiotic), was extracted 2 minutes after he passed away.
So yes IITKGP, nobody is to blame here, the friends, the totowala in front of Nehru hall, BC Roy Hospital, no one, it was purely an accident and one which brought sadness in the entire institute after what happened 3 days ago/

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** Idk about this incident. But BC roy is kind of incompetent
Whenever I've taken my friends to the emergency room, first they'll do paperwork, then they'll send it to the doctor. In the papework also first they'll write in the register then in some paper then do stamp and will ask the same thing 2-3 times. Instead, send the patient to doctors if he/she isn't occupied and ask the formalities to the patient's friends. And also normal visit hours is test of patience

**2.** [deleted]

**3.** I am fresher. Just got to know about the incident and that guy was from my hometown. RIP

Lately I‚Äôve been seeing so many posts about people feeling low, so here‚Äôs a little nugget of advice for everyone: prioritize your vitamin D! If you‚Äôre a fan of fish, indulge to your heart‚Äôs content‚Äîsalmon, mackerel, and tuna are like goldmines of vitamin D. For my vegetarian friends, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîyou‚Äôve got plenty of options like fortified milk, orange juice, cereals,bananas and even those sneaky sun-kissed mushrooms.
Here‚Äôs the deal: vitamin D isn‚Äôt just a random nutrient; it‚Äôs a game-changer for your mood and overall mental health. Think of it as your body‚Äôs internal sunshine. Research has shown that low levels of vitamin D are often linked to feelings of depression. It helps regulate serotonin, the ‚Äúfeel-good‚Äù hormone, which means a lack of vitamin D can leave you feeling more ‚Äúmeh‚Äù than motivated.
Now, let me be honest‚Äîgetting your vitamin D levels up won‚Äôt magically erase the weight of past traumas or provide a cheat sheet for the struggles you‚Äôve been battling. But here‚Äôs what it can do: it helps your body and brain function at their best. It‚Äôs like fixing a leaky roof before trying to redecorate the house.
And if you‚Äôre in Kharagpur, let‚Äôs not forget the weather. The humid climate can limit your direct sun exposure, making it harder for your body to naturally produce vitamin D. So, why not give yourself a fighting chance? A simple blood test can let you know if you‚Äôre running low. Once you‚Äôre in the know, it‚Äôs easy to fix with diet, supplements, or even a little safe sunbathing.
Take care of yourself because no one else can do it like you can. A healthier you starts with little steps‚Äîand boosting your vitamin D might just be the first one.

**1.** A healthy diet has helped me a lot not only physically but mentally, glad someone said it without a gym rat mentality.

**2.** Thanks for the advice. Will surely try it.

**3.** Yeah I did a Vit D blood test on sept last yr and it was 12, way below the deficiency limit 20. Took medications from BC roy and now it's 34. I urge everyone to take the test. It's free anyways

### Description
Hi Guys,
It's sick that despite being the most populous IIT, a lot of us are single. I felt like there should be dating platform exclusively for us: Kgpians. Guess what, because no one was building this platform, I have built it myself. Please check it out at [kgpdating.in](https://kgpdating.in) and please share it maximum on your social media handles and what'sapp groups to make it more meaningful.
Let me know if you guys go through any issues related to it.
KGPdating,
From a KGPian for KGPians
Hope you find your valentine xD

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** yet another sausage fest in the making?

**2.** I do understand why the decision was made to have 'official' institute address but well you know I can have logs in my db who is dating / talking with who and yeah that can be some serious data, atleast a gossip material which I am sure even non-tech people will be able to object about.
I am not accusing that you might be doing this, but we can't be sure.
I am very much eager to think out how to solve this problem instead.
I just signed up, and yeah much data, can create a permanent digital profile for anyone who signs up.
Aslo, if someone doesn't see this as serious just flip off and understand the 'technology' which comes in the name of the damn institute you are a part of.

**3.** \> despite being the most populous IIT, a lot of us are single.
How does this make sense?
Though nice work, hoping people to make such things as projects. Though would be interested to know the security practices you have undertaken to preserve the privacy of the users.

**4.** My problem with it is how are thinking to publicize the platform because it requires girls also right?
And I don't think you can find many in reddit..

**5.** Being single is not a problem. Kgp lacks communication and interaction that results in these cases of suicides and depressions. If we could instead have a platform to increase interaction then much of this problem would be solved. Rather than focusing on dates and casual relationships which solves no problems and in tern creates more insecure and loneliness.

**6.** Bring back [KGPyaar](https://m.facebook.com/KGPyaar/)!

**7.** [deleted]

**8.** A bug I encountered was that once u put ur email in the sign in menu, u can't click the create account button, it tells u to fill the password

**9.** Hi guys,
I got a lot of DMs today around a feature to allow people to delete the account. I have just deployed these changes. You can now visit profile tab and delete your account from the database.
Also, fixed an bug which wasn't allowing people to update their profile and do things like remove some images etc. So, you can enjoy that too.
Let me know if you face any other issues.

**10.** I saw it before but can't comment as i was in the lab.
But there is some certain things i am worried.
Storing the official institute id in db is a serious issue. These things can lead to certain issues for individuals.
Again, if you don't use institute id, its hard to verify if he/she is a kgpian or not.
Now I have a suggestion, let them use normal email , but when sigining up, verify that he/she is a kgpian, and don't store it in db

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** I'm not alone in this then. My post was deleted by these pussies

**2.** Not that dog, but all dogs should be removed from the campus. Alas anytime such a measure is thought about, animal rights people stop it, without giving any alternative solution

**3.** Yes that he'll chased me yesterday too let's do something to stop this bullshit

**4.** In case any of you know folks from the kgp animal activist group please share with them this post. It has already many people talking about a particular dog.
Anyway, since the director has changed and probably things are getting better, I'll formally lodge a complaint about the dog.
Also, It sits right in front of SNVH and wait for people to cycle past it, and then it chases them. Since I have an e-cycle and along with paddling I know the fucker won't be able to catch me, so I'll make a video next time and make sure it gets spread throughout the social media.

## No, IIT KGP/India has not been let down by CodeClub

**Flair:** KGP News üì∞

**Author:** u/Low-Sentence-2792

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/1lhlrgc/no_iit_kgpindia_has_not_been_let_down_by_codeclub/)

### Description
This is a reply to a post on this subreddit saying that "CodeClub has embarrassed IIT KGP".
Firstly, Codeforces has a highly toxic and racist community. Half the times, it is difficult to understand why some particular comment/blog is being upvoted or downvoted. People follow herd mentality there.
The contest was good; problems were thoughtful and were fun. It is \*\*not\*\* the author's mistake that AI has become really good, and people are using it to cheat. If anything, it is on Codeforces to control cheating, not on the problem setters. You can try and make the problems "non-gptable", although not very successfully, and make the problems really bad for honest people. The problems that are made in such a way are not enjoyable for humans. So, there is nothing wrong here from author's part.
Next, on cancellation of Div. 1 round, well, would anyone have liked it if a problem was put in the contest that was publicly available? No. So, the authors took an appropriate decision to make it a div 2 round.
Now the most important one "problem setters leaked the contest". This is the most baseless allegation. It was started by a racist guy named "Mindeveloped" who is part of an organization "F\\*\\*k India". There is absolutely no evidence per se and let us just use our brains for a second. Do you know how difficult the process to host a contest on cf is? It takes more than a year. After all this, why would the setters leak the problem? Just so that some random Indian newbies can get good ranks. What do they gain from that? It is a shame to see people from our own college supporting such st\\*pid allegations.
About the point that low rated people shouldn't host contests, check round 1022 or check chromate's contests. You don't have to have a high rating to make good problems.
All in all, this is just a bunch of racist hate being directed and it is shameful that people from our college are supporting this.
Also, if you are wondering, I'm not a member of CodeClub; I was de facto rejected in their selections. 

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** Most people from your club cheats on codeforces, and I know that because I know personally, those people from the CSE department who are part of the club and one of them was even the tester in the previous contest. When in reality, he actually copy pastes code from Telegram after making certain changes, and he is an expert on codeforcesüòÇüòÇ‚Ä¶. Most people here from kgp have made a mockery out of codeforces by cheating just for the sake of good rating on CV. And no dont deny it, because I am also from KGP, and I know the people here.

**2.** Covering up for a club that openly admits they do bakchodi by a rejected candidate is a whole new low üòÇ
A suggestion: man up. Members of CC can cover for themselves. They not gonna give a fuck about you buddy.

**3.** Why is reddit showing me iitkgp lore

**4.** Wa grp pe kam tha jo yaha bhi aa gaye üòë

**5.** Which exam today can truly claim to be free from cheating? From JEE Mains/Advance to end-semester, mid-semester, and job entrance exams ‚Äî cheating is happening everywhere. It's time we start learning to live with it. This is the harsh reality, and no one can stop it. Long live GPT!

**6.** Funnily enough, Dominater himself was part of this F\*\*\* India org at a point. But yea, CF has a huge bunch of people who are racists and generalize a lot.

**7.** For fucks sake, stop bringing chromate as an example for "low rated coders making good problems". The only round chromate set entirely by himself was a Div. 3, and there are quite a few higher rated people in all other rounds.

**8.** Covering up huh

**9.** Second time it has happened in a contest made by them. Also "we found out a problem is copied" also happened a second time. Coincidences can happen once. Tho I am saying anything about leaking. Issue is problems being "gptable".

**10.** When you can't accept your mistake proceed to blame the environment / situation lol. You pests can do everything except blaming the cheaters right? and the idiots who are upvoting this post are prolly involved in their own cheating saga :)

Alright folks,
I came up with a (possibly shitty) idea, but hear me out.
What if we build a platform ‚Äî maybe a simple website ‚Äî to rate and review professors based on teaching quality, behavior towards research scholars, and overall conduct?
The idea isn't just to complain, but to highlight both the good and the bad. Those consistently falling short could be flagged (with valid evidence), and the data could be escalated to higher authorities for action or at least a warning.
It‚Äôll especially help new RS folks choose better guides or avoid toxic work environments. We could even extend this to management and admin departments later on.
I think it‚Äôs time we have a system that holds people accountable.

**2.** Do you really believe professors would ever be held accountable? I remember there was a suicide about an year and half ago, the victim‚Äôs parent came forward and told the media that his child was harassed by the a professor over completion of a project, with utter disrespect to any plea for extensions.
But yeah, such a website could help other students avoid certain courses and help RS students choose good guides, but I sincerely doubt if admin would even care if any professor outright stabbed a student.

**3.** Chances are these can invite legal trouble from the powerful institute.....
Better to use code names for profs and implementing an end-to-end system for absolute privacy....preferably over onion sites...just a random suggestion

**4.** Banao bhai banake spread karo info.

**5.** There are two types of RSs.. institute scholars and project recruits.. Institute scholars have all the flexibility to choose any prof as they want as guide.. infact they can even choose a Prof from a different dept as co-guide.. departments usually give 2-3 weeks time for institute RS to interact with every faculty of dep.. and a RS with institute fellowship can even change his guide/topic of research even after a year..
If someone joins a PhD under a project, then they are f\\*\\*ed.... project is the principal investigator's brain child, it is his idea, his intellectual property and the RS will be merely a labor implementing the PI's idea... with almost nil intellectual contribution in the project.. these type of project fellows are the ones who do all the r@ndi rona.

**6.** Will need to have proper scrutiny over students using this as well. A few stupid a\*\*holes is enough to mess up the entire ratings.
Only insti email can be used to login, and whatever a student inputs will be noted against their email and get them banned. But here anonymity is lost.

**7.** This is chatGPT made and can be modified further as per your inputs

## Election ki bakchodi

### Description
I'm a sophomore and it's f\_ckin brainrot to see this election lore. I always thought the nation is atleast slowly moving towards true democracy, cause the so-called educated f\_cks will be rational and not blinded by religion or other forms of groupism. But the so-called educated f\_cks of this so-called premier institute are more corrupt than Mamta bannerjee.
How the f\_ck did it reach a point where, they think these hall council members have so much power, they can buy votes for lakhs, legit force ppl and order who they should vote for. I am from rk. I was legit forcefully taken to cic with a senior who kept a watch on us. I'm now completely doubting any senior on this campus, any of their fundae or instruction, cause I realised most of them are f\_cked in their mentality.
Is every IIT like this or has kgp's entire system been completely f\_cked over. And why the actual f\_ck is there a student body for halls. As if these assh\_les have benefited from student supervision over wardens not stealing money. Everybody is stealing and I realised these hall council members are the biggest 420's.
I'm Telugu, but I honestly would never, in any sense, vote for this praneeth guy. He is dumb as f\_ck and it is very very evident. But, na friends kuda viniki support chestunaru. Vidu em pikadu. Vidu vp aithe velakemo help chesthada? Ipdi unna darithram system, inka sankanakipothadhi.
He definitely cannot think anything on his own. It appears like giving a gun to a monkey. None of the candis are great or anything, but I find sreelekshmi and amish atleast putting some brains to work and I think they would atleast not let it get shittier, if not improve anything. But everybody has their own choice. I would say follow none of these pact bs and think for urself.
Is there no way this shithole can come back to normal. Have elections always been like this in kgp and is this going to be like this hereafter. No way to change it. Is student body is itself so corrupted, no point in taking about the corruption in administration.
Can we somehow aboilish funds handling by Gymkhana or student reps. Like iitm does it ig. They only get reimbursed, not budget looting shit. I legit have goosebumps seeing all this happen.
Would like to hear from fellow kgpians, is this normal? Or is it possible that I'm just overthinking. Is there not a way to change all this?

**1.** All of this is a shitshow. The same guys who come to your doors begging for votes won't care an iota once they win. They will become nothing but a stooge to the director or whoever is it they bootlick for. Since yesterday, they have asked three to four times to vote for a particular guy, then they have the audacity to close the gates to the hostel and ask you to sign before leaving. I would have slapped the guy who did that to me if I had to ask twice to open the gate today (security Dada just opened it). So the basic idea is power corrupts people, and it is no different here, and it has been the same for an as long as I am here.
P.S: Someone needs to teach these guys basic psychology that the more you badger your voters, the less likely are they going to vote for you.
P.P.S: Okay, would not have slapped, but you get the idea.

**2.** As a 5th year student,
Last 2 years there wasn‚Äôt a single VP candidate from my hall but the ones selected were never the best candidate, especially in my senior batch, Brahmjot was by far the worst candidate, didn‚Äôt even compare with the other two, could barely speak let alone lead, still the guy won, although for less than 200 votes margin even though he should‚Äôve won with at least a 1500 vote lead considering the pacts made at the time.
KGP community is a bit better than the outside world but still wayyyy behind ideal democracy but I think it is because if someone‚Äôs from your hall, there‚Äôs a higher chance they‚Äôd help you and hence who you vote for matters a lot more than the local election.
Overall there is nothing you can do and it‚Äôs been happening since decades, even if it was ideal democracy since the beginning, there would be one person who‚Äôd misuse the hall thing and collect all votes from his hall placing others at a disadvantage requiring them to do the same, so the ideal world you imagine is never possible and it‚Äôs probably the same everywhere.
Although it‚Äôd be great if the institute didn‚Äôt choose unbelievably dumb candidates just because of pacts. At least choose someone who is decent.
Also, during the online semester I remember 5 VPs made to withdraw so that Devaki would contest alone but she was a good VP during her tenure so no complaints but the way she won was highly unethical.

**3.** This has little to do with KGP/TSG elections or Hall poltu and more to do with the paradox of democracy in general
All this publi, vote buying, hall poltu and pacts lose meaning when you enter CIC to vote, we may criticise the admin as much as we want however nobody can deny that a voter does indeed have full privacy and liberty to cast thier vote to the candidate of thier choice in the booth...and yet "IITians" still vote on the expected Hall/Soc/Gender/Ethenic lines even when under no duress to do so.
Thus, if KGP choses a monkey with a gun, that's what we deserve. The alternative is that you curb the influence of elected student representatives, but that would be dubbed as dictatorship and undemocratic.

**4.** Praneeth is the worst candidate by far, he's only relying on pacts and telgu bhaichara votes. Usey dekhkar lagta hai zabardasti khada kardiya lade ne. RK hall council is one of the most corrupt by far, paying off other HP-SSMs to make pacts with money supposed to go to hall budget. It's very sad how low the seniors at RK can stoop :( .

**5.** How did he generate these many lapdogs? What do they get in return, Parle G?

**6.** It's like this from start. Candis are selected from pacts not there candidatures

**7.** offering money to vote,intimidating someone to vote all are corrupt practice... voters are smart ..so if somone think by adopting corrupt practice he is winning the election he is making a mistake.. result will surprise

**8.** Chill out bro...everyone is hyped by this whole election thing because of Money. If you feel all these are useless, jut dont go and say it to your seniors, thy wont say much..keep a straight face with no fear in your heart, no one will fuck with you.

**9.** Lol, in my hall, they literally cut off the lights because some people were not leaving their rooms to go vote

## Clean shave for Placement Interviews?

**Flair:** Funda :snoo_dealwithit:

**Author:** u/Sad-Journalist752

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/17lvhaw/clean_shave_for_placement_interviews/)

### Description
Could someone say whether it is necessary to be clean-shaven for placement interviews? I am someone with a full beard, and I feel weird without it. Please do not try to be politically correct, just tell the stark truth about whether not being clean-shaven would affect my interviews, because, if so, I would try and get comfortable with a clean-shave from right now.

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** I'm an alumnus, and I've been to a few campuses to interview. I'm in tech, and frankly, whether you have a beard or not doesn't play into the equation. Yes, a scruffy look might raise some yellow flags, but nothing major. More important is your confidence and awareness. Choose a look, and stick with it, as long as it's neat.

**2.** Beard is absolutely fine, for any interview. It's not about being clean-shaven, but about being well groomed.
If you are concerned about what the interviewer may think, go to a barber and just ask to shape/trim your facial hair, so your beard looks swag, not scruffy.

**3.** Either have a proper well-maintained beard, or none at all. The in-between patchy look or scruffy mess raises some eyebrows, but is never a strikeout.
But the only ones who actually make a fuss about it (from what I have seen) are placement officials from 3rd tier colleges trying way too hard to suck up to companies.

**4.** something completely different came to mind when i read the title from my feed

**5.** I might get downvoted but colleges ask you to have a clean shave look is because most people, especially bachelor degree students, do not know how to keep a well maintained beard. Therefore from a macro perspective, it's easier to tell no beard for a clean look rather than micro monitor every person on whether they have a neat and crisp beard.
Does a clean look affect the knowledge they possess? Absolute not. But it does make you more presentable, which is no doubt important in the future if you want a client facing role.

**6.** If I recall an article I read, when you are clean shaven, you appear more approachable, friendly, and trustworthy as compared to when having a beard.
It said that all top salespeople, the US president candidates, etc. are always clean shaven. They do this because they want the person across to trust them and humanize them. It makes stuff easier.
So it would be that pyschology orineted logic that has trickled down to recruitment too.

**7.** Yes, shave your beard also while you're at it.

**8.** H

**9.** Be well-groomed, maintain top-notch hygiene, wear business formals, comb your hair properly, keep your beard well-cut and clean. Overall, maintain a good formal look. That should be fine.

**10.** Why take the risk?? What if you come across that one interviewer who sees your beard as unprofessional and goes on to judge you?? Shave and once you land your job, grow it back.

## "CodeClub IIT KGP just embarrassed the whole college on Codeforces" - Hmmm

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/1liawb5/codeclub_iit_kgp_just_embarrassed_the_whole/)

### Description
Both authors have posted their opinions on Codeforces, which you can read if you care to(Especially those who ask how low-rated people can set 3000+ problems). Now, for everyone who is so "embarrassed" by CodeClub, well, congratulations to your ego. Please continue to be embarrassed by CodeClub when the actual reason for the whole situation was the mindless cheaters; this post isn't here to change your feelings.
Now, coming to the topic. I don't understand why exactly the authors are held at gunpoint for cheating that they didn't have any control over.
\* Firstly, it is just so beyond me how people are doubting the authors, who've spent months of their time preparing the contest, to leak the problems. But you know, people are insane after all, so you can't help it.
\* The authors also weren't granted permission to sanction cheaters, as was confirmed, so I don't understand how they are still being accused of cheating that wasn't in their control.
\* As was also confirmed, all problems were o4-mini tested before the round by one of the testers, and problems D and beyond weren't found to be solvable. AI will keep going strong, and I'm not sure accusing authors of making problems that will keep getting GPTed as time goes on is right.
\* Regarding the current leaderboard, Codeforces does do plagiarism and AI checks, and it will rollback the ratings after some time. The process isn't fast and easy, so we have no option but to wait.
\* Regarding the quality of the problems, I found the problem set interesting, and so did many others. But if you didn't, it is fine, and I respect it.
I, for one, am proud of the authors and the whole club for pulling off this massive feat. Hearty congratulations to both authors, and I hope you both aren't demotivated by this. People will hate, that's just how society is. I'm looking forward to more contests from the club, rated or unrated.

**1.** You Do realise that one of the testers in the competition from the CSE department, second year, actually cheats by copy pasting code from Telegram by making certain changes, which if someone actually follows his activity can easily spot. And that person is openly allowed to be a tester and that too after having skipped in his profile. Now, there will be many people who will give excuses for how to justify having skipped in the profile, and I‚Äôm not talking about him, just having skipped for, I know hundred percent sure That he cheats and yet you people from The club, don‚Äôt expel these people. The guy Goes from not being able to solve two problems in Codeforces properly to being an expert in an astonishingly short period of time and that that too in such a foolish way that he actually uses sometimes answers from telegram and the inconsistency in his template in between submissions of the same question in the same contest within just few minutes, just shows how mindless this guy is and yet your club not-only has admitted him, but he‚Äôs allowed to be a tester and companies will also recruit him. I wont name the person, but anybody can just go to the testers section of the contest and look for experts, and then you can make a very good guess about who I‚Äôm talking about. And no, I am not talking about the authors.

**2.** I mean why are the top scores Indian?
As well as why the sudden jump in cheating, the questions were leaked among themselves atleast.

**3.** Can someone tell what happened in detail?

**4.** Kitna log karma farming krenge isse lmao.

## Honest Take on the Need for Change in IIT Kharagpur‚Äôs Academic Environment

**Flair:** Funda :snoo_dealwithit:

**Author:** u/Spiritual_Average1

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/1m7jq3a/honest_take_on_the_need_for_change_in_iit/)

### Description
I‚Äôve been observing something at IIT Kharagpur that‚Äôs been bothering me for a while, and I believe it‚Äôs worth putting out there for discussion.
There‚Äôs a pattern I‚Äôve noticed‚Äîmany professors, especially in certain departments, follow a very closed academic trajectory. A large portion come from a B.Tech background at Jadavpur University followed by an M.Tech or PhD at IIT Kharagpur, and then continue teaching here. While there's nothing inherently wrong with that, the lack of diverse exposure‚Äîparticularly industrial or international‚Äîcan create a very insular academic culture.
To be clear, this is not about the state or region. It's about the academic and professional echo chamber that forms when people haven‚Äôt really worked outside of academia or this geographic bubble. Many of these professors haven‚Äôt had any real-world, hands-on industrial experience, or worked in companies, startups, or global labs where engineering actually meets execution. As a result, they struggle to guide research that is both technically rigorous and practically relevant.
This often leads to:
Outdated curricula disconnected from industry trends
Lack of mentorship for students who want to build things, work on startups, or pursue cutting-edge interdisciplinary research
A poor understanding of how to motivate students who are hungry for innovation, exposure, and impact
What we desperately need is an influx of young, dynamic professors‚Äîpeople who have actually built systems, worked in the field, or collaborated with industry and international labs. People who understand what it‚Äôs like to work in the real world, not just teach from PowerPoint slides. Even if they don‚Äôt have decades of experience, the energy, relatability, and curiosity they bring can completely change how students engage with engineering and science.
Experience is valuable, no doubt. But it shouldn't come at the cost of energy, relevance. We need professors who can resonate with students, not just lecture them.
Thoughts?

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** This is a problem. However, this is mainly due to the hiring practices of the past, which have resulted in the current set of senior professors being out of sync with the students. It is challenging to understand the new generation, with a closed mindset regarding academics that many older Professors share. This is reflected in the way they teach, with a heavy emphasis on their favourite subjects, which need to be modified to cater to the current changes.
Some Professors mean well and teach well, but there is always room for improvement. I have observed that recent hires are doing well in understanding the pulse of students, particularly on more practical matters such as industry suitability and focusing on current research topics.
However, they also bear the brunt of the department when they attempt to establish a new lab or receive less support when introducing a new course, as the big decisions are made by a faculty committee dominated by senior Professors. Things are changing. As the current set of new professors reaches higher in the administration, they will be more likely to consider the need for being receptive to student needs.

**2.** 1. At IIT Kharagpur, the quality and nature of research conducted by faculty members vary significantly. Based on observation and informal assessment, the distribution can be broadly categorized as follows:
\* \*\*Approximately 10%\*\* of the faculty are engaged in cutting-edge research that aligns with international standards. Their work is frequently published in reputed journals, and they often collaborate with global institutions. This group includes professors both from IIT backgrounds and those from other institutions who have demonstrated exceptional academic rigor.
\* \*\*Around 30%\*\* are conducting research that is strong by national standards. These professors have a solid grasp of their subjects and remain updated with current trends and advancements within their fields. Their teaching and research reflect a clear understanding of core concepts.
\* \*\*Another 30%\*\* are involved in decent, topic-specific research. While they may lack a deep understanding of foundational principles across physics, mathematics, or the broader subject area, they have developed expertise in their chosen niches.
\* \*\*The remaining 30%\*\* appear to operate at a level comparable to that of faculty at many state universities. Their research output and engagement with contemporary academic developments tend to be limited, and the quality of both teaching and research may not meet the expectations.
It is presented on analysis across 10 departments at IIT Kharagpur, there appears to be a notable variation in the quality and focus of research among faculty members. About 50% of professors at IIT Kharagpur have completed at least one postdoctoral fellowship abroad. So, this can be considered as a trend.
2. While some may believe that the curriculum at IIT Kharagpur is outdated, this perception is not entirely accurate. The curriculum is reasonably well-updated and thoughtfully structured. It's important to understand that cutting-edge technologies cannot be taught from the first year without first building a strong foundation in mathematics and core concepts. In fact, exposure to advanced technologies typically begins around the 5th semester, by which time students have acquired the necessary theoretical background.
Beyond that point, the curriculum aligns well with international standards, and many professors incorporate content from recent research papers into their teaching, ensuring that students are engaged with the latest developments in their fields.
3. Almost 70% of the young professors have the kind of background you‚Äôre referring to.

**3.** The curriculum is not outdated. Speaking as a mechE, in fact in the name of advancement a lot of foreign unis have stopped going into deep maths in grad level courses and talk about new tech recent papers but a lot of the grad students lack strong fundamentals, especially the ones not from great bachelor colleges. Honestly there is a trend nowadays to shit on people working on fundamentals. But without a strong first principles approach how can new tech proceed is beyond me. IITs curriculum enforces a strong maths background on each topic which definitely helps in long run. You can ask professors to include maybe 10% of the curriculum to talk about new age tech in the field but doing away with existing is not the way.
Regarding research the biggest challenge in India is to get fundings. Make in India is a silent killer, most of the expensive equipments and chemicals are imported and facing huge taxes. Writing grants and getting the allocated funding is a challenge in itself. You cannot do cutting edge research without money. Hence most of the Profs have to fall back on doing simulations on computers. They then become part of hiring committee and then ask experimentalist postdocs questions like how will you acquire funds to continue experimental work? More simulations based researchers are preferred, on the contrary if you want cutting edge research and application based outcomes, you need to do experiments. Where is the money? Foreign unis are always preferring experimentalists and getting funding for them is easier.

**4.** Truth be told, this is academic incest. And yes, it is diluting the quality of academic environment here. I‚Äôm sure that many, if not most, would agree to this. But this is what it is.

**5.** you know all these things are overhyped .. in the age where dollychai wala is the new icon, these humble modest prof will look dumbass to you or genz..

**1.** This place has been setting new lows with every passing day ever since I came here. Whatever aspirations my parents had when I secured an admission here have shrunk to me just coming out alive of college right now. Is this what we get for cracking the most difficult entrance exam in the country?

**2.** We need an open house session like the one that happened in 2022, 2 cases in one semester and still people acting like it's normal.

**3.** I believe, that it‚Äôs not just an issue with the institute, but a fundamental cultural problem, within our nation. We have a culture that is closely linked and associated with the aspect of survival, and getting ‚Äòahead‚Äô in life at the expense of others. That probably explains our nonchalance and indifference in such situations. I don‚Äôt really want to stir anything up here, but I feel that such a culture needs to be dismantled.

**4.** Someone out there is blaming the management cursing the place and all yapping pure shit..... Here we need to realise just one thing...we need to be good and strong at our personal level, and keep our friends and acquaintances in touch....all your being busy in college stuff to become academically better would mean nothing if you cannot be a good human being. If you lose the basic and most important virtue of being a human....I really cannot express how lightly all the people are taking this thing and how pathetic I feel about it. We failed as human beings. Please give this a thought..how are we contributing to prevent any such incidents in future?

**5.** It‚Äôs unbelievable. There‚Äôs a dearth of empathy and humanity here. This, however, is not surprising, given how most people here are pushed to the very brink of survival. Maybe this holds all over our country‚Ä¶

**6.** theres a severe shortage of empathy among the people of this institute

**7.** I had lost all respect for the place back in my first sem itself when my PoW prof said my genuine doubt was just " common sense " to him, sorry sir me and around 160 of my batchmates lacked it , which is why they couldn't find anyone except you to award a Nobel Prize.

**8.** This place is a shithole tbh, honestly nobody cares if someone lost their life, exam postponed let's celebrate chalo ghum ke aate hai like seriously, and then you say why don't you open up to others as if they care, this has become a problem deeply rooted in us the students.

It's really concerning when the first reaction people have over a suicide is celebration over the postponement of an exam.
This is unfortunately the reality of students of this supposed institute of national importance. It's no surprise that noone feels safe and comfortable to talk about their problems with anyone else.
Whats the point of being extremeley academically bright or getting a high paying job if we can't even be decent human beings first.
I am literally fed up with the general atmosphere of this place.

**1.** A single death is a tragedy, multiple deaths are statistics.
I'm a sophmore now and there's been a suicide every semester since I've been here. It is incredibly unfortunate, but at the same time you cannot expect students not to get desensitized if the frequency of such occurrences becomes so high.
When I first heard about a suicide in my first year, I was naturally upset. But over the 4 semesters the impact of such news has become lesser and lesser.
As unfortunate as it is, this is the harsh truth here.

**2.** True bhai ! Experiencing this since last 3 years. People are toxic as fuck. There is selfish , There is toxic and then there are some KGP folks.

**3.** folks have got way too comfortable saying the most vilest shit and getting no repercussions..

**4.** this is what happens when you bring in the best students of the country to a single place.The students have passed jee advanced not because they are intelligent but because they are hardworking and have a strong sense of individualism.This individualistic aspect of the student make them insensitive to others sufferings

**5.** This is just so sad. I just feel sad and heartbroken that a person whom i never knew until now and who was with us and is no more and i cant imagine the pain of the his family and friends over his loss. I just feel that it is not that hard to be kind, be sensible, and empathetic yk . idk if anyone ever read this, look out for your friends whom you might have seen sad and talk to them. and anything ,and i mean anything is not worth taking your own life. Just be kind to everyone especially yourself , have a smile on your face always and talk to your loved ones whenever you feel low. And I promise u that anything that is troubling you will pass away. I just wish that this never happened.

**6.** Aaj exam ho jaate toh achha hota

### Description
I recently graduated from the institute (2025 passout) and recent incidents make me feel bad as well but just a reminder to make the most out of this college experience
Life after Kgp will be much less flavourful and you will miss college more, don't let small setbacks make you forget that this is the time to explore and make as many mistakes as possible
After college you'll have to manufacture backchodi where in Kgp it is a way of life have a long term view and think what a 5yr older version will think of you in a particular situation you face at campus
Just invest in people help them ,talk with them and expect nothing in return and trust me you'll meet one the best people you'll ever in your life
Take charge of your life I know life is not easy but it is how it is play sports join activities or even create something,just don't sit free that's the major issue
If any issue reach out to seniors and I am sure you'll figure out who will help even alums as well talk your mind out believe me good people will not judge
Kaafi mann tha likhne ka ,peace out ‚úåÔ∏è

**1.** I really commend you on trying to share some positivity. While it is important to acknowledge and discuss the negative things and be critical of things which are not the way they should be, it is equally important to not forget the good things. It really matters for the new kids just joining the campus.

**2.** I just joined rn but
ITS SO COOLLLLLL

**3.** Example of survivorship bias

**4.** i partially disagree with that. The thing is you are preaching the kids by telling them that life will be worse than it already is, so just be happy with the current level of worse in college. Its like saying that enjoy your life in country X because country Y is worse. The thing is we as observers can just call stuff that people go through as small setbacks, but maybe they arent. I regularly read posts in this sub, and a lot of people vent their frustrations regarding their peers, clubs, societies, even sporting activities about how there is a lot of groupism and exclusion that they face. Professors, academics, a low standard of living in hostels are totally other problems they also face. Plus its worse for a lot of introverts who are not ‚Äújust able to talk to people‚Äù.
Honestly i myself should apologize that I am unable to provide a solution to help with their problems. I have gone through the problems that i stated above myself, and for me focussing on my ambitions worked. My suggestion would be keep moving forward, there is a better life out there, i always look forward to it, kgp is just a difficult level you have to go through.

**5.** lmao

**6.** Many may not agree but the more you become ambitious, the more you want great things in life, the more you will be unhappy. I will just say to not try too hard if it's hurting you. Just step back and enjoy a little. Do whatever makes you feel happy even if it means you are living a ordinary life. People don't say this but simple life can give you more happiness. Earn enough money so that you can live a proper healthy life. That's the only thing you will need to stay happy.

**7.** Pls don't degrade IIT by calling it a college....you should call it IIT, institute or university

**9.** [deleted]

**10.** Ok free advice from a senior:
- Particapte without the expectation of receiving prize money, just focus on the learning
- If you feel that you wont learn much and the event/society has a bad track record of giving out money, then dont participate
- Participate for prize only if you know for sure that they wont scam you of money.
For example, in my experience, Chess Club never gives prize money/goodies but GOC does give it quite honestly in my experience.
TLDR: Be professional while taking these decisions.

4th suicide in a year, 3rd in this semester. High time we speak up ! RIP brother üòû

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** We heard, but none of us know the details. Care to enlighten us ?

**2.** I highly feel the counselling center is not efficient enough. The counsellors should be replaced by more competent people.

**3.** See in this matter , I'm just expressing my opinions.
Now think carefully if a person is deciding to suicide is it really a problem of administration? A person lived in KGP for 3 years, fuck the councelling center , wasn't he able to make a single good friend to whom he can talk for 15 mins about his sufferings? The main reason which seems here is summer started and he was not able to get an internship ( most probably judging from the LinkedIn) . So if it is the reason then is it really a problem of administration that they were not able to provide a good internship? Bro sometimes things get hard you have to take some decisions but SU\*CIDE? Seriously? Imo nothing values more than self's life. The personal and family matters are the different things but without knowing the reason we can't blame the Institute. If he would have done the same at home noone would have ever talked about it...
It is the population KGP has which increases these types of fragile hearted people in Kgp who can't think anything else than suicide. Imo without knowing the reason we're blindly making allegations on the insti
Generation by generation the thinking of the people is going narrowed these are the only reasons these kind of incidents are increasing imo.
Ik I am getting -100 upvotes but nobody has balls to deny my statements you know that.

## Advice to pre-final/final year juniors: apply for ALL credit cards offered in KGP

### Description
You may not realise now the benefits of having a lifetime-free premium card immediately, but they are insanely useful (lounge access, cashbacks, etc.). Especially when you later apply for the credit cards and then you find out that you have to pay Rs. 5K per year in fees.
As for which cards are being offered? It varies, so just keep an ear out or ask your batchies or seniors. SBI Elite is probably still being offered to final year students.

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** HDFC credit card with IIT Kharagpur engraving on the card.
ICICI Sapphiro
That's all for IIT students.¬†
If you're from IIM ABC, you would get SBI Aurum too.¬†
Make sure to open SBI wealth savings account too while you're still a student. I've missed it.¬†
SBI Elite wasn't there during my time in KGP.

**2.** Underrated advice ngl. I still kick myself over missing this.

**3.** P.S ICICI cards no longer offer free lounge access starting from 15th November (I think). They want you to pay up 75k minimum in the previous quarter to get lounge access.

**4.** WTF is this advice.
LTF CC are useful - yes.
You can't get them after you leave kgp - No.
Its really very easy to fall into debt traps with them. Get one when you feel you need one.
And most of these cashback and offers are now reduced/limited by the banks gradually. And they will further be reduced. But you know what will not change, your habit of relying on CREDIT.
Banks don't do charity.... period.

**5.** Parents are not allowing me to get one
They say it is like taking a loan.
Can someone explain why taking a credit card will be beneficial also, I will not take/but anything on credit. Whenever I buy something, I pay everything then and there itself. Is it for me then?
Or for those who take on credit and pay later

**1.** "However, all these wins came at a great cost. His daughter, who had earned admission into the IITs, gave up her seat because of the kind of harassment Kumar was under from the establishment. He even lost his wife in 2016 from all the stress caused by the suspension and other disciplinary proceedings. But he was brave enough to see through a struggle that brought with it real reform."
Salute

**2.** Prof. Rajeev Kumar was fighting KGP administration, maybe from 2001 or 2002.. it was only in 2011 that he saw some victories... Ex: In 2001, HCL gave computers at 10K to students.. and this was also made a point to harass Prof. Kumar..
Only CSE and Archi departments used to come for chai en masse, either to staff canteen or Nescafe (which was newly started).. .. and Prof. Kumar was never part of the group.. he was treated as an outsider..
This harassment peaked when PPC was Dean and later Diro... PPC had his own fan boys both home grown and US based...

Once I was sleeping after the end sem was over when group of seniors blasted loud music and and were dancing, I being awake for 2 straight days due to exams just quitely asked them to stop it and they complied. And yeah this happened in MS
And yeah ask them firmly and not introducing yourself as a sophie

**3.** Request mat kar they will target. Better anonymously ek warden aur Deansa ko mail kar

**4.** We do, where nobody knows how to drive or not to pollute public properties, where people are super corrupt and steal crores of rupees from the public, where people are most bothered by a comment on someone who is disturbed by music in a different block but stay quiet when someone kills themself.

Which block are you on?
Also, if you are in any clubs, reach out to your seniors who are in MS, or they might have friends in MS who can talk on your behalf. But only do it IF that senior doesn't stop doing it after you talk.

### Description
Im in 3rd year, Non circuital, 7.2 CG, decent at CP (1700 CF and 5\* CC) and have completed almost everything on algozenith. Want SDE role. Intern nahi lagi. I really hate my department and don't like studying my curriculum subjects at all. So I dont think I can cross 7.5 with only 1 sem to go before placements. I dont think getting over 7.5 would make any difference considering im from non circuital. How should I approach placements? Should I even consider CDC an option? Or should I completely look for off campus opportunities? What are my chances of bagging an SDE offer? My family is suggesting to prepare for CGL im really anxious and confused.

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** Dude if I were you, I'd double down on my cp and would chase 1900 or 2100. That way, even if you don't have other factors by your side, you'll do definitely well in coding tests(which are difficult) be it off campus or on campus. And in off campus cg won't matter. And also, off campus is not that difficult. It's only difficult for people without skills. I've seen so many people get off campus offer based on their skills. Keep grinding!

**2.** Different topic but how you get such good cf ratings?
I am a second year and haven't started cp yet , doing striver's DSA sheet for now(leetcode questions)
Any suggestions on how to start , what to do?

**3.** Get this clear the only thing which would better your chances is going to great level in CP like a high CM or a Master. Let's say you became a master, a lot of companies have easy medium problems in OAs often solvable by Mid Experts except for a few companies like Graviton & DE Shaw. When the problems are easy and many people can do of course branch and cg will play the king role. And even if you do well in Graviton or DE Shaw, they would still prefer a CS guy who might not have done say all 3/3 like you but with a 9+ cg.
I suggest you improve yourself in CP to a CM at least and grind in Quant Profile, SDE is not gonna work easily for you.

**4.** I don't have much idea on SDE side of things but as a general rule - CDC placements should be a priority.
Let me explain, freshers need to be hired, trained and mentored well - it's a long term commitment with a lot of upfront investment on the employer's part. Folks with 1.5-2 years of experience usually understand the basics of their field and don't need as much training. So very few firms hire freshers off campus and prefer hiring experienced folks.
Phatna is normal but give it your best shot and see what happens - try to go beyond 7.5, practice coding and get your CV reviewed from 2-4 seniors.
Opportunities are endless after Kgp if you keep on improving your skillset as you grow, CDC placements are just the beginning and not the end!
Good luck!

**5.** Don't skip CDC. It's random. Anything can happen. I got into a sde role with a ML research profile. You are already way ahead of the crowd with those ratings. Keep doing CP. Try to get 1900 CF. This gives you an upper hand for both CDC and off campus.

**6.** I will keep it short, and elaborate if you need it.
- Don't miss CDC, keep trying, luck is also a factor. You never know what events would align together to lead to your placement, no one knows bhai.. don't just leave it. On campus placements are relatively 'easy' in terms of the exposure and chance to be able to get into the process of hiring in a company.
- Focus on your skill sets.
- Focus on DSA, it's the harsh reality. If you don't wanna do it and know its consequences then it's fine.
- Try to find connections in the target company and ask them however they can help you.

**7.** [deleted]

**8.** Bro ... Same boat as u . Non-circital and 3rd year. CP - 1670, CC - 5 STAR... Intern nhi lga .. But in placement mostly companies see ur skills . Yeah Branch, cgpa, Girls are prioritise but U can make it . And try offcampus from now . Look for internship and then get a ppo. If u even got stucked try TCS free NQT : get job in TCS offcampus it is easy as they conduct exam in offline centers and crack best profile there 9+ lpa and also Infosys offcampus where u can get 9.5+ lpa one of my friend from NIT got offcampus in Infosys and due to he was from nit and also interview went good he got offer of 13 lpa so IITian will get little more. In TCS and Infosys chances of getting OA is 100% as they do mass hiring . Many companies such as Uber and all give direct OA offcampus. After then u can switch company..
After 8-9 months after that ... Not branch nor cgpa would matter. Life is big .. U have 38 years to earn. As we have the same problem we can make a strategy and can prepare together.

**9.** off campus

## BCRTH being shifted/merged with SPMSH: Does it bother you?

### Description
Recently there was some notification regarding the shifting of BCRTH to the new hospital building that is outside the campus. It seems that it‚Äôs being done in haste and no proper consultation with related stakeholders was undertaken.
Students are going to be severely affected by this move. However ineffective and insufficient the campus hospital has been, merging it with a public hospital that too almost 2-3 kms away is going to cause lots of inconvenience for the campus community, students included.
Can we do something about it? What‚Äôs your thoughts, students and alumni (and faculty and staff, if any)?

**1.** Going a little deeper
Sample collection will be conducted at BCroy but reports will be available at SM

**2.** He has lost his mind. It's because he knows he has no power, he has lost his grip, and that's making him feel powerless and frustrated. He's doing these crazy things to show that he still has power, but actually he doesn't. The new director will come and revert anything and everything he's trying to do with BCRTH

**3.** helipad jaana padega for health concerns.. quite far away from all of us

**4.** It looks like Prof. V. K. Tewari is taking actions which he can use to justify his tenure as the Director of IIT Kharagpur (especially in light of the recent allegations of inefficiency by the IIT Teachers‚Äô Association).
Personal Opinion: It is a very very bad decision.
Why?
It takes the hospital FAR away from the students and faculty/staff. Being a student, I know exactly how often I procrastinate visiting the BCRTH just because it takes away 3-5 hours of my day (for specialists of-course). I wonder if I will ever visit that hospital if this decision is not reverted. God knows how long it will take ambulance to come to my hall in case of any emergency.
Obviously, the scenario may not be as bad as I am imagining if the execution is done perfectly. Although we all know how ‚Äòperfect‚Äô the administration is.
Hoping for the best! ü§û

**5.** chutiye hain ye log

**6.** What are the actual benefits of the new hospital, including the facilities and changes it will bring?

**7.** I heard that the shift to the new state-of-the-art hospital facility has been temporarily halted, and once again, a beneficial decision for everyone has been derailed by politics. The sole reason cited is its distance‚Äîan issue that lacks perspective. When BCRH was first established, the student intake was 100. Over the years, this number grew to 500, and today it stands at 1600+. The current infrastructure has already crumbled under this pressure, and yet some resist change because they would have to travel an additional 2-4 kilometers.The new facility, planned years ago, is not just for now; it will also serve medical students(courses starting soon) and benefit hospital staff, professors, and students alike.Yet, in India, we all know that nothing moves forward without politics. A critical, long-term solution is being sacrificed for short-term convenience. It‚Äôs time we prioritize progress over politics.

**8.** Administration kuch kare to bhi problem, aur na kare to bhi problem ! Kya chahte hai ye log !!

## Disclamer : Never go to the pond behind the Gymkhana alone !!!!!!!!

### Description
Hey everyone! So, I‚Äôve been at IIT KGP for only two weeks, just starting to get the hang of things, when I had a rather \*enlightening\* experience last night.
Picture this: it‚Äôs a calm evening, and I‚Äôm casually wandering around the campus with a couple of friends, feeling all explorative and adventurous. We decided to stray a bit from our usual path and ended up near the backside pond of Gymkhana. Harmless enough, right? WRONG!
We stumbled upon what can only be described as the campus's unofficial make-out spot. Seriously, it was like walking into a scene from a rom-com gone wrong. Couples were \\*everywhere\\*, making out in the dark, completely oblivious to our presence.
Now, imagine our faces - we were like deer caught in headlights, unsure whether to laugh, run, or cover our eyes and pretend we saw nothing. I‚Äôm pretty sure we were more embarrassed than they were (or maybe they were too busy to notice our mortified expressions).
Lesson learned: if you don‚Äôt want to feel a pang of jealousy about being single, I highly recommend avoiding that area after dark. Consider this a PSA from your friendly neighborhood newbie. üòÖ
Stay safe, folks! And maybe keep your nighttime explorations to well-lit areas. üòÇ

**1.** At times it's better to just ask your friends if you can hangout with their groups what worse can happen is won't fit in. It helped me a lot when I asked people and yeah I have a group that's a bit weird but mine. üòÉ
If it's just about the meal ask them out for the meal whenever you wanna go, that seems simple to me. Just don't overthink stuff, Communicate!

**2.** us bro us ü´Ç

**3.** Try to connect with people from your batch, will be helpful for academics as well.

**4.** Don't solely focus on making groups (I'm telling you it's not worth it :)))
Instead, try to socialize with your batchmates or the nearest people you get (you may join socs, clubs etc) (and always try to keep good people in company rather than having some people who'll drain your energy)...SPEAK and COMMUNICATE... In this way, you can make your own circle gradually...
Maybe no one is gonna tell you this but SOCIALIZING with people is important (and I'm saying this as a person with social anxiety) or you'll see yourself losing opportunities because of less connections in the future...
(But yes of course sometimes, you can enjoy the campus more and freely, when you're going out alone)...

**5.** My parents don‚Äôt give me much money, and I hardly spend time with anyone. Bro, I feel like we‚Äôre pieces of a jigsaw puzzle-scattered and waiting to fit.

**6.** Nothing wrong in eating alone bro plug your earphone and enjoy the meal. See I don't believe in making friend with efforts. These things are meant to be natural. When you find people like you they automatically become friend.

This mf at General Store in LBS hall charges more than mrp. I had purchased a bisleri 20l bottle since the water filter on my floor and neighbouring blocks either dont work or give free throat infection. The bottle has a mrp of 90 but he charges 120 for the same. When i enquired about it the owner told that it was his charge to bring the bottle to the hall. We had a little heated arguement over there. In the end he arrogantly asked me rather challenged me to buy it anywhere from the campus at mrp. Such audacity!! Now please tell me where to complain except warden as i firmly believe he is corrupted. Also suggest places from where i can buy the same cans at 'MRP'

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** Maybe hall prez or any such student body .

**2.** Investigate for other items he charges above MRP. Then file a complaint, it would be more effective. And in the end explain to him what MRP stands for !!

**3.** Lbs is on the verge of being destroyed. The warden and workers are going to be under the scrutiny of atleast a few seniors till next year. After that, it'll again become a faccha hall and there's going to be blatant corruption.

**4.** At this point just record it and put it out on a media outlet. HMC waale dalle bkl hai

**5.** Just complaint it to the warden office

**6.** Recently even I have seen him speaking rudely to students. Even I was a victim once.

**7.** Record your complaint officially via email and CC everyone possible including the wardens, asst wardens, the corrupt student council, HMC chairman and whomever in power you can think of. Use words and phrases like harrassment, manipulation etc shamelessly and rampantly. One thing that I have learnt in KGP is that these people are SHIT SCARED of documented evidence like email. Quick action will soon follow.

**1.** I encourage all KGPians to use it. Pplx Pro search with R1 is possibly the best RAG that exists today. Use it for research or to learn topics, and create a space with custom instructions to help tune responses the way you want them.
You can also add PDFs to a space to use as sources for answers. Haven't tried, but this would probably be a great way to study for a course by uploading a textbook pdf and having a back and forth with o1/r1.

**2.** If 1000 students of any college apply it will extend to 1 year they say

**2.** In reality, it's incredibly full of Shit. Simply talking about mental health isn't enough when professors are allowed to push students to the brink under the label of "world-class academics," which, in truth, is far from it. Most of the time, classes involve nothing more than reading off PowerPoint slides. Learning has been reduced to a meaningless routine of cramming the night before exams just to get grades, rather than actually understanding anything.

**3.** Apparantly during the Basic Electronic Re-examination discussion this semester. When students said that having a retest in the middle of ongoing endsems might affect their mental health. The Professors started laughing.... This shows how the professors treat mental health in our institute.

Okay forget them , where are all those people people who were so desperate during the elections - they made whatsapp groups, spammed messages, gave chits , made sure they went to every junior's room , forced them to vote, gave chits to them , blocked entraces to halls , marked the names of every person who voted, made tempo shouts, loda lassan. Infact ,they were literally licking asses of the candidates like it was some 5 - star desert. Kidhar ho bhai? Were you all doing it for some weed and alcohol? What was motivating you then and not now? I want to know.
I want all those brave hearts to come forward and make a initiate now, if cant make a hug bon fire , atleast lit a matchstick,
Hello mr . Vp candidate ! I dont know why the person commited suicide yesterday, but i know for sure that there are many toxic profs who have potential in them to make people hang in future, So you are the official powerful student i think. So are gonna do some thing about it? Or u just wanted to become fachich\*d and hence u became vp.

2. The awkward alignment is ugly AF and I don't know what we are all doing with the crazy design teams for tech/cultural festivals, rangoli+illu specialists and a fckin architecture department in the campus, still we cannot get a signage right :3

Posting on behalf of a friend who doesn't have enough karma:
I'm a boarder of VSRC, although I'm not a fan of cricket I went to watch one of our cricket gc matches. I saw a team batting in a blue red kit and they kept getting bowled out for ducks or getting run out in the most comical ways. It seemed that they had never played cricket as a team before. I was later flabbergasted to learn that they were the RP cricket team who had won the GC last year, defeating the mighty Azad team. I just couldn't fathom their spectacular fall from grace, getting squashed like flies by an admittedly chhapri team like ours. Don't they get more funds and if they do why do they waste it? The evident lack of practice and communication was also concerning, why bother embarassing your hall's reputation if you aren't willing to put up a fight?

**1.** Calm down mate, panicking is the worst shit that you could probably get into.
Keep on trying, I had one of my friends ranting one night and got his interview shortlisted the same night and the offer letter the next night. If you have the skills you don't have to worry.
Just keep calm and take care of yourself mate.
Wish you All the best, machake !!!!!!!!

**2.** Hey ! SDE interviewer here . I had just been to IIT Kanpur for D1 placements. We usually have more criteria than just solving a problem .For example , I had to interview a guy who was able to solve most questions I threw at him (not all, but that‚Äôs okay, the expectations was not to solve all questions). I had given him a tree problem. When I asked him to explain his approach , he was saying stuff like ‚ÄúSo we first we go to the leftmost node . Then we work upwards to it‚Äôs root etc etc‚Äù. He was basically saying we would be using DFS and then while explaining the logic, he was explaining in terms of code, like, ‚ÄòThen we‚Äôll do ‚ÄúIf root.val < 20‚Äù‚Äô. Things like that . So basically instead of saying , ‚ÄúFor every root we‚Äôll check it‚Äôs value against 20 and we can use the same algorithm at every node and we can use a depth first approach for this. It was very clear to me that he has just memorised the code and was explaining the code(Which he has not even written yet). That would be a a reject from my side.
Additionally there were people who couldn‚Äôt communicate their idea correctly , they were rejected as well. It could sometimes be the things you said like for example if you‚Äôre interviewing for a startup and let it slip that you‚Äôre preparing for GRE or GATE they won‚Äôt hire you.
Sometimes it‚Äôs not really your fault and the companies, especially D0 and D1 get a great many number of candidates and they would have hit their quotas. Sometimes your performance is compared with your fellow selected students and then rejected. The more the candidates get interviews the clearer the bar becomes.
I hope this gives you some insight into what might have gone wrong and helps you improve and get those offers.

**3.** Ik ki retarded jeetard question hai ye but pls phir bhi bata do bina gaali diye ,
Kitni companies "lower" branches like geology k o bethne de rhi hai ?

**4.** Phase 1 is still on, isn't it?
I don't understand this post, OP wants to give up on the remaining 7-10 days of Phase 1 and try for Phase 2? How does that work exactly?
More than 7 days remain. I would suggest you focus on that first.
If you are talented, if you have skills, if you have patience, you'll get placed easily. The only trick is not to panic and not to give up.

**1.** Mine was a 3 day trip. No GUIDE if you wanna do it on budget. Only book hotel in advance. Kgp to how..... How to njp...... Njp to DJ Itenary is pretty much standard do google. We booked Hotel North Star. (wonderful rooms, cheap, not in a prime location)
It took us not more than 7k per person including everything.
1. Don't take toy train for njp to dj. Very long and boring. There is shorter cheaper route, the train provides in town. Take that in day 1.
2. Get ready to walk a lot. Trip can be very tiring. Whole town is on hills.
3. Visit all close places in day 1. Before the end of Day 1 go to the chowk where you'll find a lot of drivers. Bargain a lot to get a good deal for Tiger hills. There will be other tourists, talk to them to know the market price. Tiger hills need permission a day before....do this before evening.
4. Don't take packages from tour operators. They will FUCK in the ass.
5. The drivers need to be persuaded, they may talk sweet but are just trying to lure you in going less places for more amouny.
6. While returning to njp i would recommend you take the mirik forest route. Cab driver would know.
7. Keep single day for zoo. Its very tiring but worth it, be ready.
8. There is Tom and Jerry eatery in town .... would recommend that place. Best food ever..... Period.

**2.** Few things that a lot of tourists don't do and since you're young. These are a few remarkable things besides touristy spots that you can come later and do.
1. Go on a trail hike or forest hike. There are guided tours. No traffic. No people. Just nature.
2. Visit Happy Valley tea garden factory
3. Rent a mountain bike along with a guide. Your ass will be sore but some pain are worth it.
4. Have coffee at Himalayan Coffee
5. If you're on a tight budget, stay at hostel. Search Tara Cafe or Tara hostel.
6. Among the touristy spots, the Zoo, Rock Garden, Lepcha Jagat pine forest, Lamahatta are worth going.
7. Tiger Hill sunrise are nice but it's too crowded. One can have similar views from ten different spots in and around town. Be open to those as well. Because viewing sunset or sunrise in isolation is a spiritual experience
8. If you drink, try Tongba or Chyang. You may not like it or you may love it but life's too short to stay comfortable
9. Eat thali at Mohan's at the clubside taxi stand. Discard hyped up restaurants they have mediocre food and bad service.
10. Eat at local momo joints.
11. I think this last suggestion works for all our country. Be Open. Surrender. Ours is such a wonderful magnificent country that we are surprised at every new place so to fully appreciate it, be open and flexible.

**3.** Post in r/kolkata

**4.** Caters to all budgets. Whats your budget? You can go by shared taxi or train or rent a bike in siliguri.
Can live in a homestay away from town ornin a budget hotel.
Hence need to know your budget.

**5.** Now it depends. First would be a cost between flights or trains. If under a budget I‚Äôd say skip both and take a bus, much better and comfortable plus 1500 is the ticket price. Once you reach Siliguri, the car will be a major cost. 3K at least each way. If you opt for shared vehicles, cost will be much lesser. Hotels follow the same thing. Higher end hotels would be 8-10k, middle range which is comfortable with amenities around 3-5K. Try looking for cool airbnbs as well or some budget hotels but make sure they‚Äôve proper backup and stuff. Day 1, don‚Äôt do anything except for touring around the mall as you‚Äôll be tired, have momos at kunga, do your usual Glenarys or keventers. Next day try for tiger hills. Cost depends on season. But I think bargaining is the key here. Afterwards try going to the zoo, the other spots and all. Avoid toy train, good for pics but v expensive. If you‚Äôve time do batasialoop and ghum area. Keep another day for lamahatta, it‚Äôs beautiful. Try looking for off best spots a bit away from darj too, maybe spend a night there. Darj can be overcrowded. But maybe within 10-15 K a trip can be done. Do keep in mind cheaper isn‚Äôt always better here, comes with a lot of conditions. And pls bargain alot and don‚Äôt always buy stuff in mall, they are barely original and come from Siliguri, alot of China ka stuff too. ;)) anything else do message me

**6.** Don't know about advice but I should somewhat caution you about 6 things I experienced -
1. Toy train charges Rs 1000 - 1500 per person for just 2-3 km which is VERY less distance for the price. And it'll go beside the same road where your car will go regularly, no different view or route just traffic. So unless you're an aristocrat guy willing to throw money for nothing, avoid it. This may sound controversial but honestly not worth the hype. It'll take you from NJP to Darjeeling with the same price and better view so if you have enough time you can travel in it for a day.
2. For Tiger Hill, if it's tourist season, wake up WAY too early. Like 3 am or even don't sleep lol because there's TOO much traffic and you won't reach within sunrise. There's a point somewhat below the hill, you can watch sunrise from there also if you miss it.
3. Ropeway will have a very long queue so you have to spend time there too.
4. Darjeeling is just a cluttered town, nothing to do there other than spending time in Malle. The real points are outside the town. So make out each day for each different town or place.
5. DON'T book car from hotel they'll charge more. Go to the taxi stand or Malle entrance and negotiate
6. Although u mentioned you're going with friends but still pointing this out. NEVER even think of planning Gangtok after Darjeeling if you have middle-aged people with you. That route is extremely nauseatic

**7.** Come to njp railway station, take direct share cab to Darjeeling (300 bucks ish each). Stay around lamahatta if possible. Enjoy view of kunchenzonga.

**8.** Goto Mall road look for a hotel then ask the hotel for trip 9/10 times it will be cheaper and better talking from personal experience

**9.** Go to gangtok instead of Darjeeling

**10.** Cfbr

## Really concerning thoughts about the recurring issue students ending up dead

**Flair:** Funda :snoo_dealwithit:

**Author:** u/Space_Child68

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/1m3dge6/really_concerning_thoughts_about_the_recurring/)

### Description
I really don‚Äôt know what to say. There is no band‚Äëaid fix to this issue. A severe restructuring is needed to create proper channels for discussing problems‚Äîproblems that are currently only addressed through gossip. Every part of the KGP ecosystem contributes to this. Everyone needs to be extremely concerned about this; otherwise, statistically, from a parent‚Äôs point of view, your kid has a 6/1400 chance of being dead if you send them to KGP.
No one comes in as a fresher thinking about taking their life. But something very specific to the KGP ecosystem changes people over 3‚Äì4 years on campus, to the point where they decide to end their lives. Can we pinpoint a single issue? NO. It is the entire ecosystem.
Things that need to be done are:
1. \*\*Extensive investment in mental health resources:\*\* Hire more mental health professionals who absolutely respect privacy. Why is there only one counseling center that no one wants to approach? There is broad acknowledgement‚Äîeven on social media‚Äîof mental health issues. Why can‚Äôt the administration prioritize making this the number‚Äëone goal before anything else, and revamp the mental well‚Äëbeing resources? Invest real money in this. Why is this always ‚Äúa work in progress‚Äù?
2. \*\*Academic reforms:\*\* Students need to feel welcome in all domains, so they can be happy and look forward to each day in KGP. Make rigorous career counseling part of the academic curriculum, because most jobs have nothing to do with your engineering degree. Why do I need to get an Ex grade in some obscure department course that only tests memorization skills? Update the coursework in all departments. Make it possible for every student to get what they want from the IIT degree‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a job or a future career path of their own choosing.
3. \*\*Hostel culture:\*\* How is it that your hostel mate is planning suicide, and you have no idea? Either you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with them, you‚Äôve never spoken to them, or you don‚Äôt even know them at all. Many students in a hostel barely talk, and when they need someone, they have no one to turn to. The orientation program helps in some ways, but it is primarily rooted in fear. The extensive General Championship is an outlet to show talent, but what if you don‚Äôt want to? Join a society, they say‚Äîbut what if no one accepts you?
After surviving the JEE pressure cooker, students don‚Äôt want to step into another pressure cooker. When you are expected to succeed in something or perish, it becomes a personal struggle, and excessive pressure to participate makes things worse. People need to be chill about GCs and elections. If you want to be excited, be excited‚Äîbut don‚Äôt pressurize others. At the same time, every hostel resident should feel safe. What I cannot accept is that after the orientation program, the part where you can actually bond with a senior and get their help does not happen with the same enthusiasm as the fear‚Äëmongering part. Both are important. I want to feel at home in my hostel, not on my toes, hiding from seniors in case they ask me to participate in some GC event. The way we take pride in Illumination, we should also take responsibility for failing these students and be answerable to their parents.
I am ashamed to be an alumnus of this oldest institution. I would advise my own child against joining this college, because there is a 6/1400 percent chance they might end up dead. Kids come here to learn and to achieve the IIT dream, which means getting a job. Ensure that it happens, no matter what. Revamp the education system so that students want to attend the 7:30‚ÄØAM lectures‚Äîeven after practicing for the hall dramatics event at 3‚ÄØAM the night before. Ensure that if a student faces financial difficulties, the institute is supportive and doesn‚Äôt just expect them to figure it out on their own.
If someone wants to code, let them code‚Äîdon‚Äôt make them get an Ex in Engineering Drawing. In universities in the USA, students genuinely want to study Agriculture and Food Engineering, or Ocean and Naval Architecture. Make these fields so relevant and engaging that the same happens in KGP. Everyone here has a great opportunity to make their life better. Everyone is important. Professors should take note of that. The administration should take note of that. Students should take note of that.

## Life after Graduation

How is life after Kgp in a job curious about potrayal by various urban legends like
1) colleagues are not friends
2) you become lonely as there is nothing to do in tier 1 cities
Things we don't realise or overlooked while being in kgp
A final year graduating this year

**1.** "colleagues are not friends"
Not true.. Worked in Korea, Canada, Japan.. made many friends especially Koreans, Iranians, Vietnamese, Chinese etc.. Iranians are the best. In second or third meeting they invite us for lunch/dinner and their cuisine is awesome. Canadians are friendly, but only in confines of office, out of office they have their own circle. Japanese like to socialize with foreigners but they are very timid by nature.
"you become lonely as there is nothing to do in tier 1 cities"
Yes.. True to certain extent.

**2.** The points you shared aren‚Äôt entirely accurate because, as humans, when we move to a Tier 1 city, we often don‚Äôt put in the same effort to build a community as we did in college or at home. It‚Äôs not just about the environment‚Äîit‚Äôs also about the initiative we take.
Staying connected and making life fulfilling requires effort from your end. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a collective push from everyone around you; instead, it starts with you. The key is to take the first step‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs reaching out to old friends, making new ones, or engaging in activities that bring you joy. Over time, the connections will naturally follow, and life will become easier and more beautiful.

**3.** Plz give internship referal.

**4.** You marry and start swinging in Bangalore or Pune.

## What happens if you disrespect a senior?

### Description
What happens if I don't take shit from a senior and tell them to fuck off? If I am not in good terms with a senior, can he affect my life in any way? I've always felt that seniors have some kind of "power" over me and not being respectful to them will have some kind of a consequence. Can somebody please clarify this to me? Thanks.

**1.** Nothing happens really. Even if you end up in hall events, seniors are usually professional enough to ignore personal differences as long as you are willing to do the same.

**2.** lauda kuch nhi hoga

**3.** Bruh focus on assignments and stuff. U won't get time to be bothered. Do some online research with abroad professors

**4.** Yes I'll clap your cheeks in a certain way you wouldn't like (im a 1st year)

**5.** From a 5th year dual degree -
If u don't like someone or someone is showing attitude etc. etc. - smoothly avoid them.... Why to make things complicated?
I also used to do the same in the yester years...
There are helpful seniors as well - seniors of my department are quite good to go with... But I never had to indulge in those bullshit AP/OP things with them... Most of the times they helped with studies, pyqs etc.
At our times also seniors threatened - "humare Baat manoge (read - pairo ke niche rahoge) toh CDc lag jayega, fukka clear ho jayega, TA log darte hai Humse, varna..... etc."
But when time has come, those guys are hardly found these days when needed, not even with binoculars or microscopes üòÇ
So try to develop peaceful and healthy interpersonal relations with those who are having a compatible mindset, otherwise ignore... simple üôÇ

**6.** You see them like enemies you will fail, you see them like mentors you learn. I always thought of second

**7.** I said some stuff to a senior once. And nothing bad happened to me, because what I said was reasonable because she was treating everyone under her year poorly. But again we had to work together so she cried once, (I didn't apologize to her, she didn't ask for it either). She came back and we continued our work. I think it all depends what kind of character you and that senior are.

**8.** Kuchh nhi bhai... But agar tu galat hai aur senior ko gaali de rha ya batchies ko bhi to consequences ho skte hain..

**9.** Meri khud seniors se pange hue hain but jaha Mai sahi thha waha Mai nhi jhuka.. lekin faltu ka jhagra bhi nhi krta. Aur koi mere saath bakchodi krta hai to fir mai usse batata hu achhe se chahe wo batchie ho ya senior

**10.** No consequences if it‚Äôs not turned into anything personal. Just mind your own business and they‚Äôll leave you alone. But then don‚Äôt come crying later that you didn‚Äôt get inputs or help from seniors. College life isn‚Äôt just about attending classes and labs; it includes building life long networks with batchies, seniors, juniors, and even professors and alums.
Fine your manifestations

- For internship/placement notifications, download ntfy and use it for mftp (you will find setup instructions on metakgp linkedin)
- Use DC++ (again metakgp linkedin) for file sharing
- For WhatsApp, use GUEST\_SECURED
- if you want to setup your own vpn, do that using TCP protocol (search for angristaan openvpn setup) because UDP won't work on campus network
- For any internet and network related issues, email to helpdesk@cc.iitkgp.ac.in or call 03222 282 391. They're usually prompt in response.
- If you wish to travel on the buses around campus, try apnainsti app to track them (search on play store)
- Feel free to comment or DM for any questions
(Don't smoke stuff) DC follows

## The Last Lesson of a Legacy: A Tribute to Our Beloved Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence

**Author:** u/According_Owl_4773

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/1lme7yx/the_last_lesson_of_a_legacy_a_tribute_to_our/)

### Description
Just like Franz in \*The Last Lesson\*, who only recognized the value of his language when it was being taken away, we too stand at a moment where something deeply personal is being lost, not a subject, but a \*sanctuary\*, a \*spirit\*, a \*legacy\*.
This hall, our hall, has been more than walls and rooms. It has been a \*home\*, a \*movement\*, a \*brotherhood\*. It is where we learned more than any textbook could teach, where we built teams, found mentors, made mistakes, and became versions of ourselves we‚Äôre proud of.
And let‚Äôs not forget its towering legacy:
\*\*This hall has given IIT Kharagpur 3 Vice Presidents in the last 9 years.\*\*
That‚Äôs not a coincidence. That‚Äôs culture. That‚Äôs leadership rooted in community, discipline, and an unbreakable bond across batches.
But today, that very culture is under threat.
In the name of a \*\*misguided Supreme Court directive\*\* and the \*\*administration‚Äôs complete apathy towards student interest\*\*, it has been decided that \*\*no second-year or senior student will be allotted to this hall anymore\*\*. This isn‚Äôt just a change in allocation. This is the erasure of tradition, of mentorship, of legacy passed down year after year.
The administration's \*\*unquestioning compliance\*\* and its \*\*increasing alienation from student voices\*\* are not just harming this one hall. They are paving the way for the \*\*collapse of the entire hall culture\*\* that makes KGP more than just an institute.
And so, to our \*respected alumni\*,
We turn to you, not out of desperation, but belief. Belief in your love for this place, belief in the bonds you once had here. You‚Äôve walked these corridors. You‚Äôve sat through the same GBMs, celebrated the same wins, and fought the same battles. \*\*Raise your voice. Stand for the legacy that made you who you are.\*\*
Because if we stay silent now, we may never get another chance.
Today it‚Äôs our last lesson. But remember
Though the lights dim, and the corridors fall silent,
\*\*This hall will roar again.\*\*
And when it does, it will roar with the strength of every soul it once sheltered.

CG 8+ kar lo warna laude lagne wale hain CDC intern mein.
Seriously these 2 sem just focus on your acads ,boost your cg as much as you can,my friends who have less than 8 cg are not even allowed to sit for most of the test.

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** Agree somewhat. But it's not like <8 cg are not getting anything, but obviously missing a lot of opportunities. So, it's a very important factor. Whoever says cg doesn't matter either has very high cg that he/she/they never knew the value of cg or very less that there's nothing much left for them to do about it. So, yes increase your cg as much as possible.

**2.** You will allowed to sit in most test as long as cg is more than 7.5(Mine was below 7.5 but still many company allowed it).But the issue is that company usually place internal cutoff after taking test as most of people are scoring full in oa.So the deciding factor become the cgpa.Unless the test is not held offline,your coding skill won't matter as interview is mostly on easier side

## For UG first years who couldn't get into a soc/club, is any hope left ?

### Description
Yea so it's starting to hit now. First sem has almost finished and I haven't gotten into some activity at all.
It isn't that I haven't tried, but it's a honest fact that 5 different socs/clubs did not take me just because I don't use social media. I can assure you that's the real reason.
So yea, it's even more difficult for me to find a social circle now, given no social media and no outgoing in college.
Someone enlightened please shed some light 

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** real question is why you need to get into one?

**2.** Skill up
Try for kdag koss AGV or some research group, quant club
Or fir bhi soc join hi karni h to
Ecell join karke third yr me vp ke liye khade hona(lmao)

**3.** Bro you are in a big delusion, soc/club don‚Äôt worth anything which you will realise later, just make good friends in your hall and good bonding within wing, involve yourself in hall activities you will not regret. Still after 1.5 years of graduation the only good memories, friends and connections are through my hall specially my wing <3.(\* Ha bandi nahi banegi bas :))

**4.** Advice from an alumnus:
-Don't bother much about socs.
-If interested in POR, try for Hall PORs.
-Socialise with your wing mates and hall boarders. Make good friends.
-Keep upskilling yourself day by day. Plan accordingly. Participate in hackathons and competitions. Reach out seniors for mentorship. Try to win in these competitions.
-Whatever you do, try to be best in that.
-Go for sports. Participate in sports events. If you are not getting the opportunity here, simply go to Jnan Ghosh every evening and try athletics.
All the best!

**5.** You can join soc in 2nd year too. Start using social media..atleast make account..

**6.** you can try in second year as well, regarding finding social circle you can start talking to your section mates and hall mates

**7.** When I joined kgp it was online. I always wanted to join some of the socs but couldn't join any. I gave interviews for about 10 socs including cells.
But couldn't get into any.
Now after graduating I don't think if it mattered that I was part of any of them.
You can still make friends and have a good social life provided that you are also trying.
Also if you want to learn something and think about joining a soc/cell would help. I really don't think so.

**8.** I won‚Äôt say that joining societies/clubs is not worth it. It is totally worth putting your all into these!
But, what is important is that at the end of your college life you have a group of friends you can call ‚Äòhomies‚Äô and tonnes of memories to cherish for life!
How can you get these? It‚Äôs very simple! Talk to the people around you. Get to know them, their interests, their hobbies. If you have something in common, do it together! If not, introduce them to your hobbies, or vice-versa. If you bring something from home, share it with them. Go to watch movies together! Hangout in the campus with them. Go on night-outs! Legit all of this is basic socializing stuff!!
And‚Ä¶ most importantly, be there for them when they need you. I can assure you that they will be there for you when you need them. If not, just ask them to be there. Sometimes it‚Äôs not obvious to them that you need them.
And poof! 4 years gone‚Ä¶ and you are left with a family and a piggy-bank full of memories! And that would be the end of my pep talk! Thanks for reading!
(Onboarding social media would be good, but you can survive without it as well!)

**9.** It's not really necessary. Hang out with your section / hall circles. Yes I agree having some activities outside studies is helpful but it's not necessarily has to be a society.
You still have more than 3 yrs left. Explore as much and take up things you really like to do, and not under peer pressure.

**10.** If you have too much free time, learn an instrument, or do something useful which will make you happy.. Or you can always do intense research about Adolf Hitler, why he wanted to obtain the holy grail or the spear of destiny.. Or you can just join gym, swimming and other sports and get a spectacular physique like Adolf Hitler.

## Changes in acads that every kgp aspirant should note

**Author:** u/SatoruFTW

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/1de348k/changes_in_acads_that_every_kgp_aspirant_should/)

### Description
I saw a lot of questions regarding the latest changes. Here is a summary.
1) Students will only be admitted to 4-year courses. Branch change has been abolished. Students can now choose to pursue a Semester-Away-Internship Program and get full credits for the same.
2) However, at the end of 1st year, students will have an option to opt for a "Dual Major" in another discipline. For example, B.S. in Economics with a Dual Major in Mathematics. You will be clearing additional creds in the department for a double major.
3) At the end of 2nd year, one would have the option to opt for a Inter-Disciplinary Dual Degree (IDDP) in either Financial Engineering (FP) or Engineering Entrepreneurship (EP) i.e. B.Tech./B.S. in parent branch + M.Tech. in FP/EP
4) Similarly, at the end of 3rd year, one could opt for IDDP in Artificial Intelligence (AI) i.e. B.Tech./B.S. in parent branch + M.Tech. in AI
5) One also has the option to convert to a Dual Degree course i.e. (B.Tech. + M.Tech.) or (B.S. + M.S.) at the end of 3rd year, in the parent branch.

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** I guess the only thing left behind is the info about petroleum engineering

**2.** Can you please elaborate about double major? Can we choose any degree we want or do we have to fulfil a specific criteria? Also, where can i learn more about the semester away program?

**3.** To opt for IDDP in AI, will anyone be allowed or do it or is it subject to availability of seats?

**4.** is it real regarding the branch change? I am eligible for Mining and oceanic engineering there, so I will not be able to switch my branch after 1st year...
also what about other 5 year courses? like from josaa I will only get 4 year courses in IIT KGP?

**5.** What are the requirements for getting financial engineering in the end of 2nd year? If it is CG then... a) on average what CG is needed? b) is that just the second year cg or cumulative of first and second year cg?

**6.** pls guide but if i do dual major will it still be a 4 year btech course? no 5 years right?

**7.** Semester away internship program when?

Until this moment most of the people believed it's the safest we can get in the hall. Apparently, central govt. schemes like Har Ghar Jal needs an offshoot, Har Hall Jal, because the hall managers simply do not care to take stock of such a basic necessity.
This is IIT, the dream until it becomes a reality and lands you up in a hospital!

**1.** This is simply the result of corrupt management from the lowest student body to the highest office in the campus. We got rotten paneer for dinner (which our warden found normal) and plastic in food in MS too.

**2.** Bhai tum logo ne Azad ki chipkali nhi dekhi kya?

**3.** Sorry for replying as this may be irrelevant but I'm a 24 jee aspirant. (Mains 99+ percentile in Jan)
Are such cases with poor basic nessecities such as food,water,rooms,basic hygiene etc a common thing across all top iits like bombay,delhi,kanpur etc as well or only in kgp?

## 2nd Year Just Started ‚Äì Feeling Super Behind and Could Use Some Real Advice

**Flair:** Funda :snoo_dealwithit:

**Author:** u/Old-Connection113

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/1mat0xo/2nd_year_just_started_feeling_super_behind_and/)

### Description
So 2nd year just started, and I‚Äôve been feeling kinda lost. I don‚Äôt really have anything to show on my resume ‚Äî no projects, no internships, no skills that I can confidently say I have.
Looking back, I pretty much wasted my 1st year. I didn‚Äôt explore anything seriously, didn‚Äôt join any clubs properly, didn‚Äôt learn anything technical, didn‚Äôt apply for internships ‚Äî just kinda went with the flow and chilled. Now I‚Äôm seeing people around me who already did internships, have cool projects, know dev stuff, or are solid in DSA, and it‚Äôs honestly making me panic a bit.
I‚Äôm thinking of starting DSA now, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm already too late to the party. If I start now and stay consistent, can I realistically catch up by the end of 2nd year? How far behind am I really?
Also, apart from DSA, what other things should I be focusing on so I don‚Äôt end up wasting this year too? I‚Äôm not asking for shortcuts or some magic trick ‚Äî just want to know what‚Äôs a practical path forward from here.
Would really appreciate any advice or even just someone telling me they‚Äôve been in the same boat and managed to turn things around. Thanks :)

**1.** first year is for fun! its fine. work hard now with the goal of getting a good internship next year. explore different fields if you aren‚Äôt fixated on coding. keep applying for remote internships (which you can do alongside semester) or in-person for next summer
"It doesn‚Äôt matter what position you find yourself in right now. What matters is whether you improve your position today. Every ordinary moment is an opportunity to make the future easier or harder."

**2.** Bro chill. I'm in my fourth year of my dual degree course, and I am being very honest here, I didn't even know about CDC in my first year and I never took CDC seriously in my second year. I saw people doing internships or having great ranks in CF from first year itself, but I didn't even care a bit about it. I was bent on doing research, and then all of a sudden second year ends, my B. Tech friends were prepping for their intern season, and a couple of personal factors led me to suddenly change my decision and I thought of trying for a software profile in CDC. In my fifth sem I was too focussed on acads and CG to do DSA or increase rating on CF, and I was so tired after the stressful sem that I never did any prep in the winter break, I was in campus for the Inter IIT Cultural Meet practices and even though my parts were not loaded at all, I was just chilling and wasting my time. I was literally jolted when I got back to reality in the sixth sem, my classmates literally had mastered all topics in dp and graphs, and I didn't even know how to construct a graph in c++. I was so overwhelmed with regret that I burnt midnight oil, stayed up till 5 am, managing lab assignments with DSA prep, had a massive drop in CG because I was more focussed on CDC prep, had a rejection from a company in the summer break from a pre internship opportunity, that too in the final HR round. Was literally depressed a day or two before CDC, but just realised in time that whatever is happening around me is not in my hands, and that I should focus on giving my best instead of thinking about the results, which were not in my control. So I maintained my composure. And I bagged an offer in my first interview on day 1. It's been a long journey, and I started from scratch with absolutely no seriousness or knowledge about CDC in my first year to cracking a day 1 offer in my first CDC interview. Anything is possible provided we have the will power, determination and the mental strength to deal with challenges however unfair life is, and the most important thing is never giving up. If you give honest efforts, it'll always bear fruit.

**3.** Honestly try to discover things u really like, take guidance from senior or peers who you believe are at a similar place you want to be also try to be active in extracurriculars and things will work out amazing üòÉ hope this helps all the best!

**4.** no one does anything in first year, grind your ass off in the second yr, and cdc will take care of the rest

## IITIANS in IES

[Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iitkgp/comments/1m7gh3f/iitians_in_ies/)

### Description
i am from a decent branch of iit kgp and i have quiet interests in govt jobs , so i need assistance and information regarding the Indian Engineering Service (IES). But i have some insecurities like as i see my friends and seniors are grabbing high paying jobs and if i skip the corporate world to do my interests , then i may lead a very ordinary life . So i am confused . 

### Top 10 Comments
**1.** Get a high paying job man..... you can wipe your tears with the money. And government sevices in india, in any field of engineering has a lot of corruption, you won't be fulfilled at all no matter how rosy your dreams are right now. And you might not be fulfilled in corporate either but atleast you'll have more money....

**2.** Nothing will ever give you the opportunity at disproportionate wealth creation at almost zero risk like being in the government services.
Also, folks here who keep talking about how you have to take money under the table have absolutely no idea how institutionalised corruption is in our country.

**3.** So I know a thing or two about skipping corpo/normal path.
First off, I took up MSc physics even though my rank allowed a bunch of engineering branches.
Next, I graduated during covid and the pdh chances being low due to COVID I took up placements and got placed with byjus. 3 years I worked there. It was the "normal corporate" thing you mentioned. I hated it. I later took a research position that paid half as much, even less. I loved that.
But for personal reasons I had to quit research. I felt that corpo is the only path remaining and I took up a jee teaching gig. My salary jumped 4x as compared to research. Guess what? I hated it. I left it to start my own coaching classes where we prioritize anxiety free, lab based learning. When I started it, I had to cut my salary by 66%, and I had to invest almost all I earned in a different kind of tuitions, didn't know if it will even work. I loved it. I still do.
So I've taken two copro paths, ones byjus and could have gone to stuff like product management, then this jee coaching. My colleagues from both these lives are earning more. And they are happy. But that's because THEY CAN BE HAPPY THERE.
I, unfortuantely or fortunately, do not find satisfaction there. As the owner of a small business I get to earn in bumps and keep a large sum of money with me at times, it leads to financial security. I also sometimes have had absolutely no money. Anyways, I get to choose a lot of things that my corpo friends don't, there's a lot of freedom and I love it. I also love the challenge and unpredictability this life brings. One freedom is to live far from the city, and I hence live in a bigger and nicer house than most of my corpo friends and probably will be able to buy a bigger/nicer house when it comes to it.
Point is, there are two kinds of people, people who like the normal, and it gets them salaries and predictability and security. And people who can't fit into that and they need the freedom, they get freedom and if you try enough things something or the other will work out.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with either. So if you miss our on the sweet corporate salary, you will definitely find something else in this IES thing. Don't worry about money, choose the type of life you want.

**4.** Do you enjoy administrative work? Do you like money or service more? If you like money, do you care how you earn that?
Becoming an IES officer would demand equivalent work of a director in a 50-100 people company. The people you work with will be much less intellectual (regular contractors, your junior engineering officers(5-10 etc).

**5.** Just do what floats your boat. If you keep comparing yourself to your friends and seniors you will never be satisfied even if you get placed in Optiver. No one gives a fuck of what you do after you graduate from here.

**6.** (Not an iitian) joining mnit jaipur, but know an ies officer, perks ye h ki the journey to being a chief is v fast than the normal route, also you will be earning way more than any of your corporate colleagues even abroad‚Ä¶ , plus if you keep some regular things going on in your life maybe sports meeting friends regularly, I don‚Äôt think it would be that dull. Might face constant pressure from administrators and mlas
