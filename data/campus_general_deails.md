## **I. Institutional History and Legacy: From a Symbol of Repression to a Beacon of National Progress**

The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT KGP) is not merely the first and largest of India's premier technical universities; it is an institution uniquely forged in the crucible of the nation's struggle for freedom and its subsequent aspirations for self-reliance. Its history is a profound narrative of transformation, where a site of colonial oppression was reborn as a cradle of technological advancement, forever embedding a sense of national purpose into its core identity.

### **A. The Genesis of an Idea (1946-1950): A Nation's Technological Aspiration**

The story of the IIT system began before India's independence, in the final years of British rule. In 1946, a committee was established by Sir Jogendra Singh, a member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, to consider the creation of higher technical institutions essential for India's post-war industrial development.1 This initial step led to the formation of a more formal 22-member committee headed by the distinguished industrialist Nalini Ranjan Sarkar.1

The Sarkar Committee's report was visionary. It recommended the establishment of four major technical institutes, one in each region of India—East, West, North, and South—modeled after the globally renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).2 Crucially, the committee envisioned these institutions as more than just undergraduate engineering colleges. They were to be comprehensive centers of learning, engaged in advanced research and responsible for producing the next generation of technical teachers. The report explicitly recommended a student body ratio of two undergraduates for every one postgraduate student, establishing the research-intensive character of the IITs from their very inception.3

Following these recommendations, the decision was made to establish the first institute in the eastern region. West Bengal was chosen due to its high concentration of industries at the time, a strategic decision championed by the then Chief Minister, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, who successfully persuaded India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, of the state's suitability.1

### **B. The Hijli Detention Camp: A Hallowed Ground of Sacrifice and Rebirth**

The location chosen for this first IIT was profoundly symbolic and historically unique. The campus was established on the grounds of the former Hijli Detention Camp, a prison built by the British in 1930 to incarcerate political revolutionaries fighting for India's independence.1 This makes IIT Kharagpur the only major educational institution in the world to have begun its life in a prison house, a fact that is central to its ethos.2

The site is hallowed ground, marked by a tragic event that galvanized the nation. On September 16, 1931, British police opened fire on unarmed detainees, killing two young freedom fighters: Santosh Kumar Mitra and Tarakeswar Sengupta. The incident sparked widespread outrage, drawing strong condemnation from national leaders, including Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who came to Hijli to claim the martyrs' bodies, and the Nobel laureate Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, who voiced his protest against the brutality of the colonial regime.2

The deliberate choice to transform this symbol of repression into a "temple of modern technological learning" was a powerful statement of a newly independent India's ambitions.4 It signified a direct conversion of a place of subjugation into a source of national strength and progress. The main administrative building of the camp, now renamed

**Shaheed Bhawan** ("Martyr's Building"), stands today as a monument to this legacy and houses the Nehru Museum of Science & Technology, ensuring that the institute's foundational story of sacrifice and rebirth is never forgotten.1

### **C. The Inaugural Years (1950-1958): Laying the Foundation**

The institute was officially born in May 1950, initially named the Eastern Higher Technical Institute. It began functioning from a small office at 5, Esplanade East in Calcutta before shifting to its permanent campus at Hijli in September 1950\.1 The name

**Indian Institute of Technology** was formally adopted just before its inauguration on August 18, 1951, by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, India's first Minister of Education.2

The first academic session commenced in August 1951 with a modest cohort of 224 students and 42 teachers spread across ten departments.1 The initial classrooms, laboratories, and administrative offices were all housed within the historic buildings of the former detention camp, which had also served as a US Air Force base during World War II.1

The institute's formative years were shaped by exceptional leadership and international cooperation. The eminent scientist Sir J.C. Ghosh served as its first Director, providing the able stewardship needed to guide its growth.2 In March 1952, Prime Minister Nehru laid the foundation stone for the new main building, an architectural marvel with its majestic central tower, designed by the renowned Swiss architect Dr. Werner M. Moser.2 This development was supported by a consortium of 13 international universities, including MIT and the University of Manchester, under the auspices of UNESCO, highlighting the global significance attached to the project.5

### **D. Milestones of National Importance and Expansion**

On April 21, 1956, the institute held its first convocation, with Prime Minister Nehru presiding over the ceremony. Among the graduating class was Jogendra Singh, who would go on to found the influential IIT Kharagpur Alumni Association, a testament to the strong bonds forged in those early years.5

A pivotal moment came on September 15, 1956, when the Parliament of India passed the **Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act**. This legislation officially declared IIT KGP an "Institute of National Importance" and granted it the status of an autonomous university, empowering it to set its own curriculum and award its own degrees.1 For its first seven years, IIT Kharagpur stood alone as the sole IIT, paving the way for the establishment of its sister institutions in Bombay (1958), Madras (1959), Kanpur (1960), and Delhi (1961).5

From its original ten departments, the institute has undergone immense expansion. It now comprises 19 academic departments, numerous multi-disciplinary centers, and several schools of excellence.1 Its academic portfolio has diversified far beyond its initial engineering focus to include programs in management, law, architecture, humanities, and even medicine, with the establishment of schools like the Vinod Gupta School of Management (VGSOM), the Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law (RGSOIPL), and the Dr. B.C. Roy Institute of Medical Science and Research.1 In recognition of its sustained excellence and contribution to the nation, the Government of India conferred upon it the prestigious status of an

**Institute of Eminence** in 2019\.1

### **E. The Institute Today: A Legacy of Excellence**

Today, IIT Kharagpur stands as a titan of Indian education. It remains the largest of all IITs, with a vast, self-contained campus spanning 2,100 acres that is home to a community of over 15,000 residents, including approximately 10,000 students.2 Its motto,

**"योगः कर्मसु कौशलम्" (Yogaḥ Karmasu Kauśalam)**, is a verse from the Bhagavad Gita translating to "Excellence in action is Yoga".1 This philosophical ideal, combined with the historical motto

**"Dedicated to the Service of the Nation"** inscribed on its main building, encapsulates the institute's dual commitment to achieving the highest standards of performance while contributing directly to national progress.1

The connection between its history and its identity cannot be overstated. While the other early IITs were established with direct assistance from specific foreign nations—the USSR for Bombay, Germany for Madras, the USA for Kanpur, and the UK for Delhi—IIT Kharagpur's foundational narrative is intrinsically Indian, rooted in the sacrifices of the freedom struggle.5 This unique heritage instills a distinct sense of purpose and responsibility in its community. The very ground on which students and faculty walk serves as a constant reminder of the imperative to build a modern, self-reliant India, making the "KGPian" identity one that is deeply intertwined with the story of the nation itself.

The service is timed to the academic schedule, typically running 15-20 minutes before the start of each lecture hour and making return trips 15-20 minutes after classes conclude.28 The route generally covers major halls such as RP, MS, LLR, MMM, LBS, and SN/IG-MT.28 Timings and routes can often be tracked via student-run apps like  
    *ApnaInsti*.28  
  * **External & Weekend Routes:** The institute also operates bus services that connect the campus to commercial areas in Kharagpur town, such as Big Bazar and Spencer's Retail, often via the railway station and Gole Bazar. These services typically run on weekends and have detailed schedules, although they may be subject to change or operate on a trial basis.29  
* **Rickshaws and E-Rickshaws (Totos):**  
  * Manual cycle-rickshaws and auto-rickshaws remain a common sight and can be hired for point-to-point travel within the campus.17  
  * The electric rickshaw, popularly known in the region as a "Toto," has become the dominant mode of informal public transport. These shared vehicles are inexpensive, with a typical ride between a hostel and an academic department costing around ₹10.31 Their utility and green credentials have been praised even by the institute's leadership as a form of grassroots innovation.32  
* **Public Bicycle Sharing System (PUBBS):**  
  * As part of a campus-wide green initiative, IIT KGP has launched its own 'Make in India' Public Bicycle Sharing System (PUBBS), funded by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.33  
  * This system utilizes smart, IoT-enabled locks that are controlled via a mobile app. Bicycles are equipped with GPS for location tracking and theft detection. After an initial free trial period, the service is available for a minor subscription fee, promoting eco-friendly transport and entrepreneurship.33 In addition to the institute's system, commercial services like Ola Pedal have also been available on campus, with rentals costing as little as ₹2-₹3 per use.31

### **C. Recent Developments in Student Welfare (A 2025 Snapshot)**

As of August 2025, IIT Kharagpur is undergoing a period of critical introspection and implementing rapid policy changes focused on student welfare. This has been prompted by a series of tragic student suicides on campus during the year, which has brought the issue of mental health to the forefront of the institute's priorities.42 The situation reveals a fundamental tension within a high-pressure academic environment and underscores the urgent need to balance academic rigor with the mental and emotional well-being of its students. The initiatives launched are a case study in institutional crisis management, reflecting a blend of administrative action, technological intervention, and community-based support.

* **Hostel Task Force Initiative:** In July 2025, the institute launched a mandatory, student-led task force in every hostel wing. These teams, comprising 25% of a wing's residents, operate on a weekly rotational basis. Their primary duties are to act as the "eyes and ears of the hostels," conducting peer vigilance, coordinating internally, and using a dedicated app to report any noticeable behavioral changes or signs of distress among fellow students to the hall management. This initiative aims to foster a culture of shared responsibility and increase peer interaction.45  
* **SETU Wellness Program:** The institute has introduced a new comprehensive wellness program named SETU (Support, Empathy, Transformation, and Upliftment). This program is designed to provide structured mental health support through 24/7 online counseling, one-on-one therapy sessions with professionals, and peer support groups.44  
* **"Campus Mothers" and AI-driven App:** A novel, two-pronged initiative named "HEART" (Help, Empower and Resiliently Thrive: A Mother’s Touch for Campus Wellness) was announced in July 2025\.46  
  * The first prong is an **AI-driven app** that will provide analytics on the overall mental health of the student body and offer a preliminary chat service for students to ventilate their feelings.  
  * The second prong is a physical interface of **"Campus Mothers"**—female campus residents (staff or family members of staff) who volunteer to provide emotional support and a safe space for students. This program, while well-intentioned, has become a focal point of debate. Mental health professionals and activists have raised concerns about its gendered nature, questioning why it is limited to women, and have highlighted the critical need for professional training for volunteers in ethics, confidentiality, and maintaining a non-judgmental stance. The discussion around this initiative exposes the complex challenge of bridging traditional, community-based notions of care with the professional, scalable, and ethically rigorous requirements of mental healthcare for a large and diverse student population of over 16,000.46

## **VI. Conclusion**

As of August 2025, the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur presents a compelling portrait of an institution at a dynamic juncture. It is a place where a profound historical legacy, born from India's freedom struggle, continues to shape a modern identity committed to national service and technological excellence. Its sprawling, self-sufficient campus is a living ecosystem, reflecting the broader Indian transition from traditional systems to organized, technology-driven solutions in areas like transportation and communication. The vibrancy of its student life, epitomized by grand festivals like Spring Fest and Kshitij, showcases the immense creative and intellectual energy that defines the "KGPian" spirit.

However, the institute is also navigating a period of significant challenge and introspection. The recent, urgent focus on student mental health, spurred by tragic events, has led to a wave of new welfare initiatives. These programs, from peer-led task forces to the innovative yet debated "Campus Mothers" concept, highlight a critical, ongoing effort to reconcile the demands of a high-pressure, globally competitive academic environment with the fundamental need for student well-being.

Ultimately, IIT Kharagpur is more than just an academic institution; it is a microcosm of modern India's journey. It is deeply rooted in a history of sacrifice and aspiration, while simultaneously grappling with the complex realities of globalization, technological disruption, and the evolving social contract between an institution and its community. Its path forward will be defined by its ability to harness its immense intellectual resources not only to solve the technological problems of the future but also to foster a campus environment that is as supportive and resilient as it is rigorous and innovative.
